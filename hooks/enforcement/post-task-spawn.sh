============================================================
!! AGENT SPAWNED VIA TASK !!
============================================================

An agent has been spawned. Great!

NEXT MANDATORY STEPS:

[ ] STEP 1: Verify agent type is from registry
    - Registry: claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/agents/
    - 206 agents in 10 categories
    - If you used a generic type: FIX IT NOW

[ ] STEP 2: If spawning multiple agents (parallel work):
    - Spawn ALL agents in THIS message
    - Do NOT spawn one, wait, spawn another
    - Golden Rule: 1 MESSAGE = ALL PARALLEL OPERATIONS

[ ] STEP 3: After ALL agents spawned, call TodoWrite()
    - Create 5-10 todos for all planned work
    - Format: {content: "Do X", status: "pending", activeForm: "Doing X"}
    - Mark in_progress when starting work
    - Mark completed IMMEDIATELY when done

[ ] STEP 4: Ensure domain expertise was loaded (if available)
    - Did you check .claude/expertise/{domain}.yaml?
    - If exists: Did you load it BEFORE spawning?
    - If not: Agent will create during execution

POST-SPAWN CHECKLIST:

Are ALL parallel agents spawned in THIS message?  [ ]
Did you call TodoWrite() with todos?              [ ]
Did todos include both content and activeForm?    [ ]
Did you load domain expertise before spawning?    [ ]

PATTERN REMINDER:

  Skill() -> Task() -> TodoWrite()
             ^^^^^
           (you are here)
                |
                v
          TodoWrite() <- REQUIRED NEXT

LIMITATION NOTE:
  This hook may not have access to your agent type parameter
  Validation will happen via transcript parsing
  Please ensure you used a registry agent type

STATE TRACKING:
  - Agent spawn logged (if parameters accessible)
  - Compliance check will run after TodoWrite
  - Violations recorded in state file
