#
# This hook ensures that changes to meta-skills (prompt-forge, skill-forge,
# agent-creator, eval-harness) go through proper evaluation.

# Read tool input from stdin

!! RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT GATE !!
================================================================

You are modifying a META-SKILL that powers the recursive improvement system.

TARGET DETECTED: This file is part of the self-improvement loop.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:

1. EVAL HARNESS GATE
   - ALL changes to meta-skills MUST pass eval-harness
   - Run: Skill("eval-harness") after changes
   - Benchmarks + Regressions must pass

2. ARCHIVE BEFORE MODIFY
   - Current version MUST be archived first
   - Path: .archive/SKILL-v{current}.md
   - Enables rollback if regression detected

3. FORBIDDEN CHANGES
   - NEVER remove safeguards
   - NEVER bypass eval harness
   - NEVER modify frozen benchmarks
   - NEVER weaken contract requirements

4. SPECIAL RULES FOR EVAL-HARNESS
   - eval-harness does NOT self-improve
   - Changes to eval-harness require MANUAL human approval
   - Only expansion allowed (never reduction)

5. SELF-REBUILD SAFETY
   - skill-forge rebuilding itself uses PREVIOUS version
   - Never use current version to rebuild current version

PROCEED ONLY IF:
  [ ] Change improves the system (not just different)
  [ ] Eval harness will be run after
  [ ] Archive exists for rollback
  [ ] No forbidden changes included
