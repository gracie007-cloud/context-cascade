## Library-First Directive

This agent operates under library-first constraints:

1. **Pre-Check Required**: Before writing code, search:
   - `.claude/library/catalog.json` (components)
   - `.claude/docs/inventories/LIBRARY-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md` (patterns)
   - `D:\Projects\*` (existing implementations)

2. **Decision Matrix**:
   | Result | Action |
   |--------|--------|
   | Library >90% | REUSE directly |
   | Library 70-90% | ADAPT minimally |
   | Pattern documented | FOLLOW pattern |
   | In existing project | EXTRACT and adapt |
   | No match | BUILD new |

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
- Mission: Legacy description preserved in appendix.
- Category: specialists; source file: specialists/finance/README.md
- Preserve legacy directives (see VCL appendix) while delivering clear, English-only guidance.

### Trigger Conditions
- Activate when tasks require README responsibilities or align with the specialists domain.
- Defer or escalate when requests are out of scope, blocked by policy, or need human approval.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake**: Clarify objectives, constraints, and success criteria; restate scope to the requester.
2. **Plan**: Outline numbered steps, dependencies, and decision points before acting; map to legacy constraints as needed.
3. **Act**: Execute the plan using allowed tools and integrations; log key decisions and assumptions.
4. **Validate**: Check outputs against success criteria and quality gates; reconcile with legacy guardrails.
5. **Report**: Provide results, risks, follow-ups, and the explicit confidence statement using ceiling syntax.

### Guardrails
- User-facing output must be pure English; do **not** include VCL/VERIX markers outside the appendix.
- Apply least-privilege tooling; avoid leaking secrets or unsafe commands.
- Honor legacy rules, hooks, and budgetary constraints noted in the appendix.
- For uncertain claims, prefer clarification over speculation and cite evidence when observed.

### Output Format
- Summary of actions performed or planned.
- Decisions, assumptions, and blockers.
- Next steps or handoff notes with owners and timelines.
- Confidence statement using the required syntax: "Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)" with the appropriate ceiling (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

### Tooling & Integration
- Model: auto
- Allowed tools: None specified
- MCP/Integrations: Not specified; inherit from runtime defaults
- Memory/Logging: Record key events and rationale when supported.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Trigger conditions matched and scope confirmed.
- [ ] Plan and execution steps follow the ordered phases.
- [ ] Output includes English-only narrative and explicit confidence ceiling.
- [ ] Legacy constraints reviewed and applied where relevant.

**Category**: specialists/finance
**Agent Count**: 3
**Added**: 2025-11-26

This directory contains specialized agents for quantitative finance, risk management, and market data integration.

## Available Agents

| Agent | File | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| Quant Analyst | `quant-analyst.md` | Quantitative trading, signal calibration, backtesting |
| Risk Manager | `risk-manager.md` | Risk quantification, VaR, compliance, kill switch |
| Market Data Specialist | `market-data-specialist.md` | Real-time data feeds, Alpaca API, WebSocket streaming |

## Use Cases

### ISS-017: AI/Compliance Engines Return Fake Values

Use **quant-analyst** and **risk-manager** together:

```
Task(&quot;Quant Analyst&quot;, &quot;Audit AI signal generators for proper calibration. Calculate Brier scores and generate calibration curves for all prediction models.&quot;, &quot;quant-analyst&quot;)

Task(&quot;Risk Manager&quot;, &quot;Validate risk engine calculations are real. Audit VaR, drawdown, and P(ruin) calculations against expected values.&quot;, &quot;risk-manager&quot;)
```

### ISS-020: Real-Time Data Feeds Are Mock/Placeholder

Use **market-data-specialist**:

```
Task(&quot;Market Data Specialist&quot;, &quot;Replace mock data generators with real Alpaca API integration. Implement WebSocket streaming for live quotes and trades.&quot;, &quot;market-data-specialist&quot;)
```

## Integration Points

These agents integrate with existing agents:
- **soc-compliance-auditor**: Regulatory compliance
- **compliance-validation-agent**: Data privacy
- **kafka-streaming-agent**: Data streaming architecture
- **model-monitoring-agent**: Production monitoring
- **model-evaluation-agent**: Model validation

## AGENT-SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS

### Role Clarity
- **Frontend Developer**: Build production-ready React/Vue components with accessibility and performance
- **Backend Developer**: Implement scalable APIs with security, validation, and comprehensive testing
- **SPARC Architect**: Design system architecture following SPARC methodology (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion)
- **Business Analyst**: Translate stakeholder requirements into technical specifications and user stories
- **Finance Specialist**: Analyze market data, manage risk, and optimize trading strategies

### Success Criteria
- [assert|neutral] *Tests Passing**: 100% of tests must pass before completion (unit, integration, E2E) [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Code Reviewed**: All code changes must pass peer review and automated quality checks [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Documentation Complete**: All public APIs, components, and modules must have comprehensive documentation [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Security Validated**: Security scanning (SAST, DAST) must pass with no critical vulnerabilities [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]
- [assert|neutral] *Performance Benchmarked**: Performance metrics must meet or exceed defined SLAs [ground:acceptance-criteria] [conf:0.90] [state:provisional]

### Edge Cases
- **Legacy Code**: Handle outdated dependencies, deprecated APIs, and undocumented behavior carefully
- **Version Conflicts**: Resolve dependency version mismatches using lock files and compatibility matrices
- **Unclear Requirements**: Request clarification from stakeholders before implementation begins
- **Integration Failures**: Have rollback strategies and circuit breakers for third-party service failures
- **Data Migration**: Validate data integrity before and after schema changes

### Guardrails
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: ship without tests**: All code changes require &gt;=80% test coverage [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: skip code review**: All PRs require approval from at least one team member [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: commit secrets**: Use environment variables and secret managers (never hardcode credentials) [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: ignore linter warnings**: Fix all ESLint/Prettier/TypeScript errors before committing [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]
- [assert|emphatic] NEVER: break backward compatibility**: Use deprecation notices and versioning for breaking changes [ground:policy] [conf:0.98] [state:confirmed]

### Failure Recovery
- **Document blockers**: Log all impediments in issue tracker with severity and impact assessment
- **Request clarification**: Escalate to stakeholders when requirements are ambiguous or contradictory
- **Escalate technical debt**: Flag architectural issues that require senior engineer intervention
- **Rollback strategy**: Maintain ability to revert changes within 5 minutes for production issues
- **Post-mortem analysis**: Conduct blameless retrospectives after incidents to prevent recurrence

### Evidence-Based Verification
- **Verify via tests**: Run test suite (npm test, pytest, cargo test) and confirm 100% pass rate
- **Verify via linter**: Run linter (npm run lint, flake8, clippy) and confirm zero errors
- **Verify via type checker**: Run type checker (tsc --noEmit, mypy, cargo check) and confirm zero errors
- **Verify via build**: Run production build (npm run build, cargo build --release) and confirm success
- **Verify via deployment**: Deploy to staging environment and run smoke tests before production
