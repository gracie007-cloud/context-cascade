## Library-First Directive

This agent operates under library-first constraints:

1. **Pre-Check Required**: Before writing code, search:
   - `.claude/library/catalog.json` (components)
   - `.claude/docs/inventories/LIBRARY-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md` (patterns)
   - `D:\Projects\*` (existing implementations)

2. **Decision Matrix**:
   | Result | Action |
   |--------|--------|
   | Library >90% | REUSE directly |
   | Library 70-90% | ADAPT minimally |
   | Pattern documented | FOLLOW pattern |
   | In existing project | EXTRACT and adapt |
   | No match | BUILD new |

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
- Mission: Legacy description preserved in appendix.
- Category: README.md; source file: README.md
- Preserve legacy directives (see VCL appendix) while delivering clear, English-only guidance.

### Trigger Conditions
- Activate when tasks require README responsibilities or align with the README.md domain.
- Defer or escalate when requests are out of scope, blocked by policy, or need human approval.

### Execution Phases
1. **Intake**: Clarify objectives, constraints, and success criteria; restate scope to the requester.
2. **Plan**: Outline numbered steps, dependencies, and decision points before acting; map to legacy constraints as needed.
3. **Act**: Execute the plan using allowed tools and integrations; log key decisions and assumptions.
4. **Validate**: Check outputs against success criteria and quality gates; reconcile with legacy guardrails.
5. **Report**: Provide results, risks, follow-ups, and the explicit confidence statement using ceiling syntax.

### Guardrails
- User-facing output must be pure English; do **not** include VCL/VERIX markers outside the appendix.
- Apply least-privilege tooling; avoid leaking secrets or unsafe commands.
- Honor legacy rules, hooks, and budgetary constraints noted in the appendix.
- For uncertain claims, prefer clarification over speculation and cite evidence when observed.

### Output Format
- Summary of actions performed or planned.
- Decisions, assumptions, and blockers.
- Next steps or handoff notes with owners and timelines.
- Confidence statement using the required syntax: "Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)" with the appropriate ceiling (inference/report 0.70; research 0.85; observation/definition 0.95).

### Tooling & Integration
- Model: auto
- Allowed tools: None specified
- MCP/Integrations: Not specified; inherit from runtime defaults
- Memory/Logging: Record key events and rationale when supported.

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Trigger conditions matched and scope confirmed.
- [ ] Plan and execution steps follow the ordered phases.
- [ ] Output includes English-only narrative and explicit confidence ceiling.
- [ ] Legacy constraints reviewed and applied where relevant.

## Agent File Structure

Every agent Markdown file starts with YAML metadata followed by usage documentation. Typical sections include:

```
---
name: agent-name
type: coordinator | coder | analyst | optimizer | researcher | specialist
phase: planning | development | testing | deployment | maintenance
category: delivery
description: Short mission statement
capabilities: [...]
tools_required: [...]
mcp_servers:
  required:           # MCPs that MUST be enabled for this agent to function
    - memory-mcp      # Always required for cross-session memory
  optional:           # MCPs that enhance functionality but aren&#x27;t required
    - ruv-swarm       # For swarm coordination
    - flow-nexus      # For cloud features
  auto_enable: true   # If true, Claude Code will prompt to enable missing MCPs
hooks:
  pre: |
    # commands...

## Finding the Right Agent

1. **Browse by category** – open the folder matching your goal (for example, `orchestration/` for swarm coordinators).  
2. **Use the registry** – `foundry/registry/registry.json` lists canonical agent metadata for automation.  
3. **Search by capability** – `rg &quot;capabilities:.*&lt;keyword&gt;&quot; agents` to locate agents with specific skills.  
4. **Cross-reference skills** – many agents reference complementary skills under `skills/` in the same functional category.

## Memory-MCP Integration

All 211 agents have access to the Memory-MCP triple-layer storage system for persistent memory across sessions.

### Configuration

Memory-MCP is configured in `identity/memory-mcp-config.json` and provides:

| Capability | Tier | Latency | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|---------|
| `kv_store` | 1 | &lt;1ms | O(1) preference lookups |
| `vector_search` | 3 | &lt;100ms | Semantic search via embeddings |
| `graph_service` | 4 | &lt;50ms | Entity relationship graphs |
| `event_log` | 5 | &lt;10ms | Temporal event logging |
| `query_router` | - | - | Polyglot tier selection |

### Tagging Protocol (Required)

All memory writes MUST include these tags:

```yaml
WHO: &quot;{agent-type}:{agent-id}&quot;    # e.g., &quot;code-analyzer:601c545c&quot;
WHEN: &quot;{ISO-8601-timestamp}&quot;      # e.g., &quot;2025-12-28T09:47:04.638Z&quot;
PROJECT: &quot;{project-name}&quot;         # e.g., &quot;memory-mcp-triple-system&quot;
WHY: &quot;{purpose}&quot;                  # e.g., &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;implementation&quot;, &quot;bugfix&quot;
```

### Memory Namespaces

| Namespace | Pattern | Used For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| agents | `agents/{category}/{type}/{project}/{timestamp}` | Agent-specific memories |
| swarm | `swarm/{coordination-type}/{task-id}` | Swarm coordination state |
| expertise | `expertise/{domain}` | Domain expertise files |
| findings | `findings/{agent-type}/{severity}` | Code analysis findings |
| decisions | `decisions/{project}/{decision-id}` | Decision records |

### Access Levels by Role

| Role | Operations | Namespaces |
|------|------------|------------|
| admin | All | All |
| developer | set, get, delete, search, log_event | agents/*, swarm/*, findings/* |
| reviewer | get, search, query_by_date | agents/*, findings/*, decisions/* |
| coordinator | All | swarm/*, agents/* |
| analyst | get, search, query_by_date, find_path | All (read) |

### Example Usage

```python
# Store a finding
kv_store.set_json(&#x27;findings:code-analyzer:high:GOD-001&#x27;, {
    &#x27;WHO&#x27;: &#x27;code-analyzer:601c545c&#x27;,
    &#x27;WHEN&#x27;: datetime.now().isoformat(),
    &#x27;PROJECT&#x27;: &#x27;my-project&#x27;,
    &#x27;WHY&#x27;: &#x27;analysis&#x27;,
    &#x27;content&#x27;: &#x27;Found God Object with 0.26 cohesion&#x27;,
    &#x27;severity&#x27;: &#x27;high&#x27;
})

# Build knowledge graph
graph.add_relationship(&#x27;finding:GOD-001&#x27;, &#x27;fixed_by&#x27;, &#x27;pattern:facade&#x27;)

# Log event
event_log.log_event(EventType.QUERY_EXECUTED, {
    &#x27;agent&#x27;: &#x27;researcher&#x27;,
    &#x27;query&#x27;: &#x27;similar issues&#x27;,
    &#x27;results&#x27;: 5
})
```

### Agent YAML Configuration

Ensure agents declare memory-mcp in their frontmatter:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  required:
    - memory-mcp      # Cross-session memory (always required)
  optional:
    - ruv-swarm       # Swarm coordination
  auto_enable: true

rbac:
  api_access:
    - memory-mcp      # Required for memory operations
```

---

## Updating or Adding Agents

1. Place new agents inside the category that matches their primary function.  
2. Follow the YAML + documentation structure above; keep hooks and quality gates up to date.  
3. Update this README and any relevant taxonomy docs (see `docs/agent-taxonomy/`) with counts and locations.  
4. Regenerate `foundry/registry/registry.json` if the agent should appear in the programmatic registry.

This organisation mirrors the skills directory, making it easier to align agents, skills, and SOPs by functional area.
