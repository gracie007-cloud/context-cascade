# /agent-health-check

Monitor agent health status, performance, and resource utilization in real-time.

## Usage
```bash
/agent-health-check [agent_id] [options]
```

## Parameters
- `agent_id` - Specific agent to check (default: all active agents)
- `--interval` - Check interval in seconds (default: 5)
- `--duration` - Monitoring duration in minutes (default: continuous)
- `--metrics` - Metrics to collect: cpu|memory|tasks|all (default: all)
- `--threshold-cpu` - CPU usage alert threshold % (default: 80)
- `--threshold-memory` - Memory usage alert threshold % (default: 85)
- `--alert` - Enable alerting (default: true)
- `--export` - Export metrics: none|prometheus|json (default: none)

## What It Does

**Comprehensive Agent Monitoring**:
1. 💓 **Health Status**: Alive, responding, stuck
2. 🧠 **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network
3. 📊 **Task Metrics**: Active, queued, completed, failed
4. ⚡ **Performance**: Response time, throughput
5. 🔍 **Error Detection**: Crashes, hangs, timeouts
6. 🚨 **Alerting**: Threshold violations
7. 📈 **Trend Analysis**: Performance over time
8. 🔄 **Auto-Recovery**: Restart unhealthy agents

**Monitored Agents**:
- Swarm coordination agents
- SPARC methodology agents
- Integration agents (GitHub, multi-model)
- Custom workflow agents
- Background task agents

## Examples

```bash
# Check all active agents
/agent-health-check

# Monitor specific agent
/agent-health-check coder-agent-123

# Continuous monitoring with 10s interval
/agent-health-check --interval 10 --duration 60

# CPU and memory only
/agent-health-check --metrics cpu,memory

# Custom thresholds
/agent-health-check --threshold-cpu 70 --threshold-memory 80

# Export to Prometheus
/agent-health-check --export prometheus

# Quiet mode (alerts only)
/agent-health-check --alert true --quiet true
```

## Output
