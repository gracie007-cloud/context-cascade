# /workflow:deployment

Orchestrate multi-stage deployment workflows with validation gates.

## Usage
```bash
/workflow:deployment [options]
```

## Parameters
- `--environment` - Target environment: dev|staging|production (required)
- `--strategy` - Deployment strategy: rolling|blue-green|canary|recreate (default: rolling)
- `--validation` - Enable validation gates (default: true)
- `--smoke-test` - Run smoke tests post-deployment (default: true)
- `--auto-rollback` - Rollback on failure (default: true)
- `--notify` - Send deployment notifications (default: true)
- `--approve-manual` - Require manual approval for production (default: true)
- `--canary-percentage` - Canary traffic percentage (default: 10)

## What It Does

**Multi-Stage Deployment Workflow**:
1. 🔍 **Pre-Deployment**: Validate readiness
2. 🎯 **Target Selection**: Choose deployment target
3. 🚦 **Validation Gate**: Quality checks
4. 🚀 **Deploy**: Execute deployment strategy
5. 🏥 **Health Check**: Monitor pod/instance health
6. 🧪 **Smoke Test**: Run basic functionality tests
7. 📊 **Metrics**: Collect performance metrics
8. ✅ **Approval Gate**: Manual/auto approval
9. 📢 **Notify**: Send deployment status

**Deployment Strategies**:
- **Rolling**: Gradual pod replacement (zero downtime)
- **Blue-Green**: Full environment switch with instant rollback
- **Canary**: Gradual traffic shift (10% → 50% → 100%)
- **Recreate**: Terminate all, then deploy new (downtime)

## Examples

```bash
# Deploy to staging with rolling update
/workflow:deployment --environment staging

# Production deployment with blue-green
/workflow:deployment --environment production --strategy blue-green

# Canary deployment with 20% traffic
/workflow:deployment --environment production --strategy canary --canary-percentage 20

# Deploy without smoke tests
/workflow:deployment --environment dev --smoke-test false

# Deploy with manual approval
/workflow:deployment --environment production --approve-manual true

# Recreate deployment (downtime acceptable)
/workflow:deployment --environment dev --strategy recreate
```
