# /workflow:rollback

Intelligent rollback orchestration with automated root cause analysis.

## Usage
```bash
/workflow:rollback [options]
```

## Parameters
- `--environment` - Target environment: dev|staging|production (required)
- `--to` - Target version to rollback to (auto-detect if not specified)
- `--reason` - Rollback reason (required for production)
- `--immediate` - Skip validation gates (default: false)
- `--analyze-failure` - Run root cause analysis (default: true)
- `--notify` - Send rollback notifications (default: true)
- `--preserve-data` - Preserve database state (default: true)
- `--deployment` - Specific deployment name (K8s only)

## What It Does

**Intelligent Rollback Process**:
1. 🔍 **Detect Issue**: Identify deployment problems
2. 📊 **Impact Analysis**: Assess rollback impact
3. 🎯 **Target Selection**: Choose rollback version
4. 🚦 **Validation Gate**: Pre-rollback checks
5. 🔄 **Execute Rollback**: Restore previous version
6. 🏥 **Health Check**: Verify rollback success
7. 🧪 **Smoke Test**: Validate functionality
8. 🔬 **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify failure reason
9. 📢 **Notify**: Send rollback status

**Rollback Strategies**:
- **Instant**: Switch traffic immediately (blue-green)
- **Gradual**: Slowly shift traffic back (canary reverse)
- **Database**: Restore DB to previous state (optional)
- **Full**: Complete environment rollback

## Examples

```bash
# Auto-detect and rollback
/workflow:rollback --environment production

# Rollback to specific version
/workflow:rollback --environment staging --to v1.2.8

# Immediate rollback (skip validation)
/workflow:rollback --environment production --immediate true --reason "Critical bug"

# Rollback with RCA
/workflow:rollback --environment staging --analyze-failure true

# Rollback specific deployment
/workflow:rollback --environment production --deployment myapp-web --to v1.2.9

# Rollback without data preservation
/workflow:rollback --environment dev --preserve-data false
```

## Output

Stage 7: Root Cause Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  🔬 Analyzing v1.3.0 failure...

  Failure Timeline:
    12:34:22 - Deployment v1.3.0 started
    12:35:08 - All pods healthy
    12:35:45 - First 500 errors detected
    12:36:12 - Error rate spike: 2.1%
    12:37:30 - Error rate critical: 12.4%
    12:38:04 - Rollback initiated

  Root Causes Identified:
    1. ❌ Memory Leak (CRITICAL)
       Location: src/services/cache.service.ts:156
       Issue: Event listeners not cleaned up
       Impact: Memory exhaustion after 2 minutes
       Evidence:
         - Memory growth: 45MB → 892MB in 3 minutes
         - Event listener count: 12,345 (expected: ~50)
         - GC unable to reclaim

    2. ❌ N+1 Database Query (HIGH)
       Location: src/api/users/get-users.controller.ts:42
       Issue: Missing JOIN, executing 1+N queries
       Impact: Database connection pool exhausted
       Evidence:
         - Query count: 1,234 per request (expected: 1)
         - DB connection time: 2,890ms (expected: <50ms)
         - Connection pool: 100/100 used

    3. ⚠️  Missing Error Handling (MEDIUM)
       Location: src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts:67
       Issue: Unhandled promise rejection
       Impact: Process crashes on auth failure
       Evidence:
         - Uncaught exceptions: 234
         - Pod restarts: 12 in 3 minutes

  Recommended Fixes:
    ✅ Add event listener cleanup in componentWillUnmount
    ✅ Implement eager loading with JOIN
    ✅ Add try/catch blocks and error boundaries
    ✅ Add integration test for auth edge cases

  Generated Report: /tmp/rca-v1.3.0-failure.md

  ⏱️  Duration: 18.7s
