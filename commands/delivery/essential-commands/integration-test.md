# /integration-test

Integration testing for API contracts, service interactions, and external dependencies.

## Usage
```bash
/integration-test [scope] [options]
```

## Parameters
- `scope` - Test scope: all|api|database|external|services (default: all)
- `--environment` - Test environment: local|staging|production (default: staging)
- `--parallel` - Run tests in parallel (default: true)
- `--timeout` - Test timeout in seconds (default: 30)
- `--retry` - Retry failed tests (default: 2)
- `--mock-external` - Mock external services (default: false)
- `--report-format` - Output format: html|json|junit (default: html)

## What It Does

**Comprehensive Integration Testing**:
1. 🔗 **API Integration**: REST/GraphQL endpoint testing
2. 🗄️ **Database Integration**: CRUD operations, transactions
3. 🌐 **External Services**: Third-party API integration
4. 📨 **Message Queues**: Event-driven communication
5. 🔐 **Authentication**: OAuth, JWT, session management
6. 💾 **Cache Integration**: Redis, Memcached testing
7. 📊 **Contract Testing**: API schema validation
8. 🔄 **State Management**: Multi-service workflows

**Testing Patterns**:
- **Consumer Contract**: Verify API responses match expectations
- **Provider Contract**: Ensure API adheres to contracts
- **Transaction Testing**: Multi-step database operations
- **Idempotency**: Repeated requests produce same result
- **Circuit Breaker**: Failure handling and recovery

## Examples

```bash
# Full integration test suite
/integration-test

# API integration tests only
/integration-test api

# Database integration with retry
/integration-test database --retry 3

# Test against staging environment
/integration-test --environment staging

# Mock external services for faster tests
/integration-test --mock-external true

# Parallel execution with custom timeout
/integration-test --parallel true --timeout 60

# External service integration
/integration-test external --environment production
```

## Output
