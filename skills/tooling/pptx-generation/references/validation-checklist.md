# Validation Checklist (PPTX Generation)

Run before delivery; note confidence ceiling.

- Storyline matches brief; slide count/sections align with ask.
- Titles are conclusions; bullets are crisp and parallel.
- Brand compliance: fonts, colors, logo usage, icon style.
- Design: contrast, alignment, spacing, consistent grids and masters.
- Accessibility: font sizes, color-independent encoding, alt-text notes, readable charts.
- Data integrity: sources cited, units shown, no hidden columns or broken links.
- Links/assets: images embedded or linked correctly; videos/GIFs tested.
- Export hygiene: remove drafts, set file name/version, clear metadata if needed.

Document results and confidence: `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.
