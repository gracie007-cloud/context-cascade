# Brand Integration Checklist

Ensure every deck respects brand guidance.

- Approved fonts and weights only; no substitutes.
- Color palette limited to brand primaries/secondaries; document hex codes used.
- Logo placement consistent; maintain clear space; avoid stretching.
- Iconography: use approved sets; align stroke weight and style.
- Tone of voice: match audience (exec vs. technical); avoid slang and unexplained jargon.
- Imagery: prefer high-quality, license-cleared assets; avoid watermarks.
- Footer/header: include date, owner, and confidentiality if required.
- Export hygiene: remove draft slides, check links, and strip personal metadata.

Record brand compliance in the validation report with confidence ceiling.
