# Design Principles (PPTX Generation)

Apply these guardrails on every deck; align with Prompt Architect clarity and Skill Forge validation.

- **Hierarchy:** title > lead point > supporting bullets; one message per slide.
- **Contrast & Color:** WCAG-friendly contrast; limited palette using brand colors; avoid low-contrast text on imagery.
- **Spacing & Alignment:** consistent margins, grid alignment, balanced whitespace; avoid crowding.
- **Typography:** on-brand fonts only; 24pt+ for body, 32pt+ for titles; avoid italics for body text.
- **Imagery & Icons:** use purposeful visuals; avoid busy backgrounds; credit sources when required.
- **Data:** label axes, sources, and units; highlight the takeaway, not the chart.
- **Accessibility:** provide alt-text notes, avoid color-only encoding, ensure reading order.
- **File Hygiene:** descriptive filenames, slide numbers, and consistent master layouts.

Validation checkpoint: run through these items before export; record confidence ceiling.
