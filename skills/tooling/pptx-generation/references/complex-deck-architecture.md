# Complex Deck Architecture

Structure long or high-stakes decks with progressive disclosure.

1. **Front Matter:** title, audience, date, owner, summary slide.
2. **Narrative Spine:** hook → problem → impact → options → recommendation → plan → ask.
3. **Evidence Blocks:** data/experiments with source notes and caveats.
4. **Design System:** section dividers, recurring visual motifs, and callout styles for risks/decisions.
5. **Navigation:** table of contents, breadcrumbs, slide numbers, and clear section titles.
6. **Appendix:** backups, methodology, glossary; keep main narrative lean.
7. **Validation:** run design principles + brand integration + accessibility; capture confidence ceiling.

Use this outline when slide count >15 or when multiple stakeholder groups are involved.
