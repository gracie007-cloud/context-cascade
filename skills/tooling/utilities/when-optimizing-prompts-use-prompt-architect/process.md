# Process – Prompt Architect Utility

1. Confirm request is prompt optimization (clarity, constraints, success criteria).
2. Package original prompt + context and send to `prompt-architect`.
3. Return optimized prompt, constraint breakdown, and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.
4. Store memory (WHO/WHY/PROJECT/WHEN) for reuse.
