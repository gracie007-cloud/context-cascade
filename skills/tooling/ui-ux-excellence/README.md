# UI/UX Excellence

Heuristic audits and improvement plans for UI/UX quality, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Quick Start
1. Define scope, personas, platforms, and success metrics.
2. Run heuristic review (clarity, consistency, affordance, feedback, accessibility, performance) with evidence.
3. Map key journeys; document friction, latency, and error states.
4. Prioritize fixes by impact/effort; propose designs or prototypes.
5. Validate and deliver with confidence ceiling and memory tags.

## Inputs
- Product area, personas, platform, goals/metrics, constraints (brand, accessibility level).

## Outputs
- Audit summary, issues with evidence, prioritized backlog, and validation notes.
- Confidence line: `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`; memory namespace `skills/tooling/ui-ux-excellence/{project}/{timestamp}`.

## Guardrails
- Evidence-first; capture screenshots/flows.
- Accessibility (WCAG) and responsiveness required.
- Confidence ceilings enforced; structure-first docs maintained.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – README aligned to Prompt Architect clarity.
