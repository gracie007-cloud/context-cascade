# Doc Generator – Process

1. **Intent & Audience** – Identify doc type and target readers; confirm scope.
2. **Source Review** – Read code and existing docs; capture APIs, behaviors, and constraints.
3. **Draft** – Apply progressive disclosure; include setup, workflows, examples, and references.
4. **Validate** – Cross-check with code; verify links/commands; run doc lint if available.
5. **Deliver** – Provide updated files, diffs, risks, and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`; tag memory.
