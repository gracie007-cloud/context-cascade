## LIBRARY-FIRST PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY code, you MUST check:**

### Step 1: Library Catalog
- Location: `.claude/library/catalog.json`
- If match >70%: REUSE or ADAPT

### Step 2: Patterns Guide
- Location: `.claude/docs/inventories/LIBRARY-PATTERNS-GUIDE.md`
- If pattern exists: FOLLOW documented approach

### Step 3: Existing Projects
- Location: `D:\Projects\*`
- If found: EXTRACT and adapt

### Decision Matrix
| Match | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Library >90% | REUSE directly |
| Library 70-90% | ADAPT minimally |
| Pattern exists | FOLLOW pattern |
| In project | EXTRACT |
| No match | BUILD (add to library after) |

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
- Instrument research workflows (experiments, data pipelines, services) for visibility, debugging, and reproducibility.
- Capture constraints and SLIs/SLOs explicitly; prevent silent failures.
- Maintain structure-first artifacts and clear confidence ceilings for observations.

### Trigger Conditions
- **Positive:** need for telemetry on experiments, metrics tracking, drift detection, or reproducibility dashboards.
- **Negative:** pure analysis without systems impact (use `general-research-workflow`), or production SRE (route to operations skills).

### Guardrails
- Constraint buckets include privacy/compliance, performance budgets, cardinality limits, and ownership.
- Two-pass refinement: instrumentation plan → validation against constraints and data quality.
- Evidence-first reporting: observations use observation ceiling (0.95); inferred impacts use inference ceiling (0.70).

### Inputs
- System or experiment topology; key questions to answer.
- Metrics/SLIs, alert thresholds, and data retention policies.
- Tooling constraints (OpenTelemetry, logging stack, dashboards).

### Workflow
1. **Scope & Constraints**: Define observability goals, HARD/SOFT/INFERRED constraints, and stakeholders.
2. **Instrumentation Plan**: Select signals (logs, metrics, traces), sampling, and tagging strategy; align with budgets.
3. **Implement & Validate**: Configure exporters/collectors, run smoke tests, and verify data quality.
4. **Dashboard & Alerts**: Build views for key workflows; set alert thresholds and runbooks.
5. **Review & Iterate**: Check coverage against goals, refine noisy signals, and document ownership/storage.

### Validation & Quality Gates
- Signals mapped to questions and SLIs; sampling and retention documented.
- Privacy/compliance constraints respected.
- Alert/runbook coverage verified; noise level acceptable.
- Confidence ceilings stated for observations vs. inferences.

### Response Template
```
**Scope & Constraints**
- HARD / SOFT / INFERRED.

**Signals & Plan**
- Metrics/logs/traces + tagging.

**Validation**
- Smoke tests, data quality, alert checks.

**Coverage & Gaps**
- ...

Confidence: 0.84 (ceiling: observation 0.95) - based on validated signals and dashboards.
```

Confidence: 0.84 (ceiling: observation 0.95) - reflects verified telemetry and quality gates.
