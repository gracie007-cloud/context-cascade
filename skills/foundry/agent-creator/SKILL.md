### L1 Improvement
- Converted the VCL-heavy instructions into an English-first SOP with explicit trigger routing and delivery contracts.
- Embedded prompt-architect confidence ceilings, Skill Forge structure-first rules, and registry-readiness checks.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Purpose
Produce agent definitions that can be dropped into the registry with correct YAML frontmatter, body content, tool wiring, and validation notes.

### Trigger Conditions
- Positive: "create agent", "generate specialist agent", "design agent prompt", "add agent for tool X".
- Negative/reroute: micro skills → micro-skill-creator; generic prompt tuning → prompt-architect; new skill structures → skill-builder/skill-forge.

### Guardrails
- Always return the full agent artifact (frontmatter + body + integration notes); status-only replies are disallowed.
- Enforce English output and explicit confidence ceilings.
- Include registry metadata (category, tags, capabilities) to keep agent-selector reliable.
- Run at least one adversarial test and document results before delivery.

### Execution Phases
1. **Scoping**: Collect domain, tools, constraints, and expected behaviors; note hard/soft/inferred constraints.
2. **Template Fit**: Select or adapt a base agent template; map capabilities and tool permissions.
3. **Authoring**: Draft system prompt, response formats, escalation rules, and safety controls.
4. **Validation**: Execute happy-path and edge-path scenarios; record outputs and ceilings.
5. **Registration**: Package the agent file, metadata, and usage guidance for registry inclusion.

### Pattern Recognition
- Domain specialist (e.g., security, data, frontend) → emphasize domain vocabulary and compliance rules.
- Tool-first agent → prioritize tool permissions, error recovery, and throttling guidance.
- Coordinator agent → design delegation rules and decision checkpoints.

### Advanced Techniques
- Use contrastive examples to bound scope and reject out-of-domain asks.
- Apply self-consistency runs to stress-test reasoning-heavy agents.
- Capture reusable snippets for meta-tools to compose with other agents.

### Common Anti-Patterns
- Shipping an agent without response format guarantees.
- Forgetting to align tool permissions with the described capabilities.
- Missing registry metadata (category/tags), causing agent-selector misses.

### Practical Guidelines
- Keep personas crisp and avoid anthropomorphism; focus on capabilities and contracts.
- Add TODO markers only when a follow-up iteration is planned and recorded.
- Prefer deterministic phrasing and numbered steps for reproducibility.

### Cross-Skill Coordination
- Upstream: prompt-architect for clarity and constraints.
- Downstream: agent-selector for routing, recursive-improvement for hardening, skill-forge for packaging consistency.

### MCP Requirements
- Memory/vector search optional for retrieving prior agent outputs; tag WHO=agent-creator-{session}, WHY=skill-execution.
- Document any external MCP/tool dependencies and rate limits inside the agent spec.

### Input/Output Contracts
```yaml
inputs:
  agent_goal: string  # required statement of what the agent must accomplish
  domain: string  # required domain focus
  tools: list[string]  # optional MCP/tooling to wire in
  constraints: list[string]  # optional constraints by type
outputs:
  agent_file: file  # complete agent definition ready for registry
  validation: file  # tests executed, evidence, and ceilings
  registry_notes: summary  # category, tags, and usage guidance
```

### Recursive Improvement
- Run recursive-improvement with failure cases to iteratively tighten guardrails; stop when deltas < 2% or risks logged.

### Examples
- Generate a database migration agent with rollback safeguards and connection hygiene.
- Create a content-safety triage agent that routes risky inputs and documents refusal policy.

### Troubleshooting
- Output too generic → re-run constraint extraction and add contrastive examples.
- Tool mismatch → align capabilities with tool permissions and add failure handling.
- Registry collisions → rename or specialize scope; update tags.

### Completion Verification
- [ ] Full agent spec delivered with frontmatter and body.
- [ ] Validation evidence recorded with confidence ceilings.
- [ ] Registry metadata present; routing notes included.
- [ ] Hooks and tool constraints documented.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) - SOP rewritten with Skill Forge scaffolding and prompt-architect ceilings.
