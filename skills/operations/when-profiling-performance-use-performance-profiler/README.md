# Routing: Performance Profiling

Use this guide when the request is primarily to collect profiles/traces.

- Broader performance analysis should use when-analyzing-performance-use-performance-analysis.
- Infrastructure or observability setup alone should use the relevant infrastructure or opentelemetry skills.

Apply the SOP: capture scope, approvals, and safety constraints; share profiling plans and artifacts; and document confidence ceilings for observations.
