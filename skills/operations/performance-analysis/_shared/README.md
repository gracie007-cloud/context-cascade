# Performance Analysis Shared Assets

Reusable helpers for evidence-driven performance investigations.

- **Checklists**: baseline, reproduction, and experiment templates.
- **Scripts**: profiling triggers, benchmark harnesses, and data collectors.
- **Dashboards**: starter views for latency/throughput/error budgets.

Use with the performance-analysis SOP: document constraints, run adversarial tests, and state confidence ceilings for all findings.
