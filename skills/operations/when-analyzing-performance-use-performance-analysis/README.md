# Routing: Performance Analysis

Use this guide when the request is to analyze or debug performance.

- If profiling-only, hand off to when-profiling-performance-use-performance-profiler.
- For observability setup without analysis, use opentelemetry-observability.

Follow the SOP: confirm triggers, assemble baseline evidence, and state confidence ceilings when routing and summarizing outcomes.
