# GitHub Project Management Resources

Helper materials for building and governing GitHub Projects.

- **Templates**: field/view definitions, workflows, and automation snippets.
- **Reference guides**: labeling, SLA policies, and permission models.
- **Scripts**: reporting and sync utilities for dashboards.

Use with the SOP: keep structure-first, test automation adversarially, and state confidence ceilings when recommending governance changes.
