# GitHub Release Management Skill

## Overview

Orchestrate end-to-end software release processes with intelligent agent coordination. This skill automates version bumping, changelog generation, release candidate testing, deployment orchestration, post-release validation, and rollback procedures for GitHub-hosted projects using comprehensive CI/CD integration.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when creating production releases with automated validation, coordinating multi-environment deployments (staging, production), generating release notes and changelogs automatically, managing semantic versioning across projects, implementing deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary), handling hotfix releases and emergency patches, or establishing release automation for new projects.

Use for both small single-repository releases and complex multi-service deployments, scheduled regular releases or on-demand deployments, and establishing release governance and compliance.

## Agent Coordination Architecture

### Swarm Topology

Initialize a **hierarchical topology** with release-manager as coordinator overseeing specialized deployment, testing, and documentation agents. Hierarchical structure ensures coordinated decision-making for critical release operations.

```bash
# Initialize hierarchical swarm for release management
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --max-agents 8 --strategy specialized
```

### Specialized Agent Roles

**Release Manager** (`release-manager`): Top-level coordinator that oversees entire release process. Makes go/no-go decisions, coordinates deployment timing, manages rollback decisions, and ensures release quality standards. Acts as release captain.

**CI/CD Engineer** (`cicd-engineer`): Manages build pipelines, deployment automation, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment strategy execution. Handles technical deployment mechanics and environment configuration.

**Test Engineer** (`tester`): Validates release candidates through automated testing, regression testing, performance testing, and smoke testing. Verifies deployment success and monitors post-deployment health.

**Code Reviewer** (`reviewer`): Performs final code review of release branch, validates security compliance, checks for last-minute issues, and approves release artifacts.

**Documentation Writer** (`docs-writer`): Generates release notes, updates changelogs, creates deployment runbooks, and documents breaking changes. Ensures comprehensive release documentation.

## Release Management Workflows (SOP)

### Workflow 1: Standard Release (Major/Minor/Patch)

Execute full release cycle from version bump to production deployment.

**Phase 1: Pre-Release Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Initialize Release Swarm**

```bash
# Set up hierarchical release swarm
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init topology=hierarchical maxAgents=8 strategy=specialized

# Spawn release team
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coordinator name=release-manager
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=coder name=cicd-engineer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=tester
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=analyst name=reviewer
mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn type=researcher name=docs-writer
```

**Step 1.2: Determine Release Version**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Determine next release version:

  1. Fetch current version from package.json / Cargo.toml / VERSION file
  2. Analyze commits since last release using git log
  3. Classify changes: breaking|features|fixes|docs
  4. Apply semantic versioning rules:
     - Breaking changes → major version bump
     - New features → minor version bump
     - Bug fixes only → patch version bump
  5. Check for forced version override in environment

  Use scripts/semver.sh for version calculation
  Store version decision in memory: release/version
  Run hooks: npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description 'version determination'
", "release-manager")
```

  --strategy "canary" \
  --canary-percentage "10,25,50,100" \
  --canary-delay-seconds 600
```

**Phase 5: Post-Release Validation**

**Step 5.1: Production Smoke Tests**

```plaintext
Task("Test Engineer", "
  Validate production deployment:

  1. Run production smoke test suite
  2. Validate critical user journeys
  3. Check error rates and latency metrics
  4. Verify monitoring dashboards showing healthy state
  5. Test rollback procedure (in separate environment)

  Use scripts/production-validation.sh
  Store validation results in memory: release/prod-validation
", "tester")
```

**Step 5.2: Publish GitHub Release**

Once production validated, publish the draft release:

```bash
# Publish GitHub release
bash scripts/github-api.sh publish-release \
  --repo <owner/repo> \
  --tag "v${NEXT_VERSION}"
```

**Step 5.3: Post-Release Monitoring**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Monitor post-release health:

  1. Track error rates for 24 hours post-release
  2. Monitor user reports and support tickets
  3. Watch for performance degradation
  4. Check for unexpected edge cases
  5. Prepare hotfix if critical issues discovered

  Use scripts/release-monitoring.sh
  Store monitoring data in memory: release/monitoring
", "release-manager")
```

**Step 5.4: Merge Release Branch**

```bash
# Merge release branch back to main
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff "release/v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git tag "v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop if using gitflow
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff "release/v${NEXT_VERSION}"
git push origin develop
```

### Workflow 2: Hotfix Release

Execute emergency patch release for critical production issues.

**Phase 1: Hotfix Initiation**

**Step 1.1: Create Hotfix Branch**

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from production tag
git checkout -b "hotfix/v${CURRENT_VERSION}-hotfix.1" "v${CURRENT_VERSION}"
git push origin "hotfix/v${CURRENT_VERSION}-hotfix.1"
```

**Step 1.2: Apply Fix and Test**

```plaintext
Task("CI/CD Engineer", "
  Apply hotfix and validate:

  1. Cherry-pick fix commits to hotfix branch
  2. Bump version with hotfix suffix
  3. Run targeted regression tests
  4. Build hotfix artifacts
  5. Deploy to staging for validation
  6. Document fix in hotfix-specific changelog

  Use scripts/hotfix.sh for automation
  Store hotfix status in memory: release/hotfix
", "cicd-engineer")
```

**Phase 2: Expedited Deployment**

**Step 2.1: Fast-Track Approval**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Expedite hotfix approval:

  1. Assess severity and urgency
  2. Fast-track security review (critical paths only)
  3. Skip non-critical validation steps
  4. Get stakeholder approval via emergency process
  5. Approve for immediate production deployment

  Store approval in memory: release/hotfix-approval
", "release-manager")
```

**Step 2.2: Deploy Hotfix**

```bash
# Deploy hotfix to production immediately
bash scripts/deploy.sh \

  --strategy "rolling" \
  --fast-rollout true
```

**Step 2.3: Backport Hotfix**

```bash
# Merge hotfix to main and develop branches
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff "hotfix/${HOTFIX_VERSION}"
git push origin main

git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff "hotfix/${HOTFIX_VERSION}"

```

### Workflow 3: Rollback Management

Handle failed deployments with automated rollback.

**Phase 1: Failure Detection**

**Step 1.1: Monitor Deployment Health**

```bash
# Continuous health monitoring
bash scripts/health-monitor.sh \
  --environment "production" \
  --error-rate-threshold 5.0 \
  --latency-threshold-p99 2000 \
  --alert-on-threshold true
```

**Step 1.2: Identify Failure Criteria**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Assess deployment health and determine if rollback needed:

  1. Check error rate spike (>5% increase)
  2. Monitor latency degradation (>50% increase)
  3. Track failed health checks
  4. Review user impact reports
  5. Make rollback decision based on severity

  Use references/rollback-criteria.md
  Store decision in memory: release/rollback-decision
", "release-manager")
```

**Phase 2: Rollback Execution**

**Step 2.1: Trigger Automated Rollback**

```bash
# Execute rollback to previous version
bash scripts/rollback.sh \
  --environment "production" \
  --target-version "${PREVIOUS_VERSION}" \
  --strategy "immediate" \
  --preserve-data true
```

**Step 2.2: Validate Rollback Success**

```plaintext
Task("Test Engineer", "
  Validate rollback restored service:

  1. Confirm previous version deployed
  2. Run smoke tests
  3. Verify error rates normalized
  4. Check data integrity maintained
  5. Monitor for 1 hour post-rollback

  Store rollback validation in memory: release/rollback-validation
", "tester")
```

**Step 2.3: Post-Mortem Analysis**

```plaintext
Task("Release Manager", "
  Conduct rollback post-mortem:

  1. Document failure root cause
  2. Identify what testing missed the issue
  3. Create action items to prevent recurrence
  4. Update release process with learnings
  5. Schedule fix and re-release

  Use references/postmortem-template.md
  Store post-mortem in memory: release/postmortem
", "release-manager")
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Deployment

Gradually replace instances with new version. Default strategy for most releases.

**Characteristics:**
- Low risk: issues affect subset of users
- Gradual rollout: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- Easy rollback: stop deployment and roll back affected instances
- No extra infrastructure required

### Blue-Green Deployment

Maintain two identical environments, switch traffic atomically.

**Characteristics:**
- Zero downtime: instant traffic switch
- Easy rollback: switch traffic back
- Requires 2x infrastructure temporarily
- Good for database migration testing

### Canary Deployment

Route small percentage of traffic to new version, gradually increase.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal blast radius: 1-5% initial exposure
- A/B testing capability: compare metrics
- Gradual confidence building
- Requires traffic routing capabilities

## MCP Tool Integration

### Task Orchestration

```bash
# Orchestrate full release workflow
mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate \
  task="Execute release v2.0.0" \
  strategy=sequential \
  maxAgents=5 \
  priority=critical
```

### Swarm Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor release agent progress
mcp__claude-flow__swarm_status verbose=true

# Get deployment metrics
mcp__claude-flow__agent_metrics metric=performance
```

## Best Practices

**Semantic Versioning**: Always follow semver strictly. Breaking changes require major version bump, features require minor, fixes require patch.

**Release Automation**: Automate all repeatable tasks. Human intervention should only be required for go/no-go decisions.

**Comprehensive Testing**: Never skip testing phases. Staging validation catches 80% of production issues.

**Incremental Rollout**: Use canary or rolling deployments for major releases. Minimize blast radius of issues.

**Rollback Readiness**: Always maintain ability to rollback. Test rollback procedure before production deployment.

**Documentation First**: Generate release notes and changelog before deployment. Documentation helps with debugging post-release issues.

**Monitoring and Alerts**: Ensure comprehensive monitoring before release. Post-release issues should trigger automatic alerts.

**Communication**: Notify stakeholders at each phase: release start, deployment begin, deployment complete, validation passed.

## Error Handling

**Build Failures**: If CI build fails, automatically abort release and notify release manager. Do not proceed with broken builds.

**Test Failures**: Any validation test failure blocks release. Investigate root cause before retry.

**Deployment Failures**: Trigger automatic rollback if deployment health checks fail. Preserve application state and data.

**Monitoring Gaps**: If monitoring unavailable, delay deployment until monitoring restored. Flying blind is unacceptable.

**Version Conflicts**: If version already exists, coordinator decides: force bump or abort. Never overwrite existing releases.

## Core Principles

### 1. Rollback is Not Failure Recovery, It is Risk Management
Treating rollback as emergency-only failure response creates organizational stigma around rollbacks, causing teams to spend hours debugging production issues instead of immediately rolling back to last known good state. This extends mean time to recovery (MTTR) from minutes to hours and increases blast radius as issues affect more users during extended debugging. Rollback should be the default response to deployment issues, not the last resort.

**In practice**: Design deployment strategy with rollback as primary recovery mechanism. Blue-green deployment enables instant rollback (route traffic back to green environment running previous version, zero downtime). Canary deployment limits blast radius (5% of traffic sees new version, automatic rollback if error rate exceeds threshold). Include rollback validation in pre-deployment checklist: test-engineer agent validates rollback procedure in staging (deploy v2.0, verify functionality, rollback to v1.9, verify v1.9 works) BEFORE production deployment. This proves rollback works when you don't need it, so it's reliable when you do need it. Cultural shift: "We rolled back in 3 minutes" is success story, not failure story.

### 2. Semantic Versioning is Communication Protocol, Not Arbitrary Numbering
Version numbers encode compatibility contracts: major version bump signals breaking changes (API consumers must update code), minor version signals new features (backward compatible, consumers can adopt optionally), patch version signals bug fixes (safe to update immediately). Violating this contract breaks dependency management across ecosystem - consumers don't know if updating requires code changes or is safe to auto-update.

**In practice**: Automate semver enforcement with release-manager agent analyzing commits since last release. Breaking changes detected (API method signature changed, removed public function, modified database schema) = major version bump required. New features detected (added API endpoint, new configuration option) = minor version bump. Only bug fixes = patch version bump. Generate CHANGELOG automatically from commit analysis: breaking changes section prominently lists migration requirements, features section documents new capabilities, fixes section references GitHub issues. Reject releases violating semver rules: if PR contains breaking change but developer proposed patch version bump, CI fails with error "Breaking change detected, requires major version bump".

### 3. Staging is Production Dress Rehearsal, Not Developer Playground
Staging environments that diverge from production configuration (different database sizes, different traffic patterns, different deployment procedures) provide false confidence - releases pass staging validation but fail in production due to environment differences. Every staging-production divergence is a potential source of production incidents that staging didn't catch.

**In practice**: Enforce staging-production parity: same database version, same infrastructure configuration (Kubernetes cluster with same resource limits), same deployment procedure (if production uses blue-green, staging uses blue-green), same monitoring (if production has DataDog, staging has DataDog). Use production data in staging (anonymized for PII compliance but preserving data volume and distribution). Run production-scale load tests: if production serves 1000 req/s peak, staging load test generates 1000 req/s to validate deployment handles production traffic. Cicd-engineer agent validates parity before each release: compares staging vs production configs, fails release if divergence detected above threshold (database versions must match, infrastructure configs must match within 5% resource tolerance).

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Manual Release Process as Single Point of Failure** | Release engineer manually runs 15-step release checklist: build artifacts, run tests, deploy to staging, smoke test, deploy to production, monitor, update documentation. Step 7 forgotten (database migration), production deploy fails, rollback required. Step 12 skipped due to time pressure (update docs), outdated documentation causes customer confusion. Releases stressful, error-prone, dependent on single person's availability. | Automate entire release workflow with release-manager agent orchestrating specialized agents: cicd-engineer builds artifacts and runs tests, tester validates staging deployment, reviewer checks security compliance, docs-writer generates changelog and release notes. Human involvement only for go/no-go decision, not manual execution. Automation eliminates forgotten steps (agents execute complete workflow every time), removes single point of failure (doesn't depend on release engineer's availability), and provides audit trail (every step logged with timestamp and outcome). |
| **Skipping Staging Validation Under Time Pressure** | Critical bug in production, hotfix developed in 30 minutes. Team deploys directly to production to "save time" bypassing staging validation. Hotfix introduces regression: fixes bug A but breaks feature B (not covered by unit tests, would have been caught by staging smoke tests). Now two production issues instead of one, extended outage. | Enforce staging validation as non-negotiable gate, even for hotfixes. Fast-track approval (reduce validation scope for hotfixes: run targeted smoke tests on affected codepath, not full regression suite) but NEVER skip. For hotfix example: deploy to staging, run 5-minute smoke test covering critical user journeys, validate fix resolved bug A without breaking feature B, then deploy to production. Total time cost: 5 minutes staging validation. Benefit: prevents regression-induced extended outages. Configure CI pipeline to block production deploys without staging approval (cannot bypass, requires infrastructure-level override). |
| **Semantic Versioning Violations** | Release changes authentication API from JWT to OAuth2 (breaking change for all API consumers requiring code updates). Developer bumps version v1.8.3 -> v1.9.0 (minor version) because "it's just a new feature". Automated dependency update tools see minor version bump, auto-update production services to v1.9.0 assuming backward compatibility. Services break with "invalid authentication token" errors. Production outage across 5 dependent services. | Enforce semver rules with automated analysis: release-manager agent scans git diff since last release, detects API signature changes (authentication method modified), flags as breaking change requiring major version bump (v1.8.3 -> v2.0.0). CI fails if proposed version bump (v1.9.0) doesn't match detected change type (major). Force major version with prominent breaking changes documentation in CHANGELOG: "BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication migrated to OAuth2. See MIGRATION.md for upgrade guide". Dependent services see major version bump, know to read migration guide before updating. |

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Manual Release Process as Bottleneck** | Release engineer manually runs 15-step checklist. Step 7 forgotten (DB migration), production fails, rollback required. Step 12 skipped due to time pressure (update docs), outdated docs cause customer confusion. Releases stressful, error-prone, dependent on single person. | Automate entire workflow with release-manager orchestrating specialized agents: cicd-engineer builds/tests, tester validates staging, reviewer checks security, docs-writer generates changelog/notes. Human involvement only for go/no-go decision. Automation eliminates forgotten steps, removes single point of failure, provides audit trail. |
| **Skipping Staging Under Pressure** | Critical production bug, hotfix developed in 30min. Team deploys directly to production to "save time" bypassing staging. Hotfix introduces regression: fixes bug A but breaks feature B. Now two production issues instead of one, extended outage. | Enforce staging validation as non-negotiable gate even for hotfixes. Fast-track approval (reduce validation scope: run targeted smoke tests on affected codepath, not full regression) but NEVER skip. Example: deploy to staging, 5min smoke test, validate fix without regression, then production. 5min cost prevents regression-induced extended outages. |
| **Semantic Versioning Violations** | Release changes auth API from JWT to OAuth2 (breaking change requiring code updates). Developer bumps v1.8.3 -> v1.9.0 (minor) because "it's a feature". Auto-update tools see minor bump, assume backward compatibility, auto-update services. Services break with "invalid token" errors. Production outage across 5 dependent services. | Enforce semver with automated analysis: release-manager scans git diff, detects API signature changes, flags as breaking requiring major bump (v1.8.3 -> v2.0.0). CI fails if proposed version (v1.9.0) doesn't match change type (major). Force major version with prominent CHANGELOG breaking changes section and migration guide. |

## Conclusion

Software release management automates the deployment lifecycle from version determination through production validation, transforming releases from high-risk manual processes into orchestrated agent workflows. The workflows documented here (semantic versioning automation, canary deployments, automated rollback) eliminate human error from release execution while maintaining human decision-making for go/no-go approvals. The fundamental challenge: releasing frequently enough to deliver value quickly while maintaining production stability.

Success requires three architectural commitments: deployment automation (cicd-engineer agent executes complete release workflow, humans approve but don't manually execute), staging-production parity (staging environment matches production configuration, load patterns, data volumes - staging validation predicts production behavior), and rollback-first culture (rollback is default response to deployment issues, not emergency fallback). Without these commitments, releases remain high-risk events requiring weekend deployment windows and dedicated release engineers.

The hierarchical agent topology (release-manager coordinating cicd-engineer/tester/reviewer/docs-writer agents) enables parallel execution of release workflow phases while maintaining sequential dependencies (testing after building, deployment after testing). This is critical for fast release cycles - serial execution of build/test/deploy/document would take hours, parallel execution reduces to minutes while respecting dependency constraints. The coordinator maintains global release state (version number, deployment strategy, go/no-go status) while specialized agents execute domain-specific tasks.

Implementation sequencing: Start with automated changelog generation (lowest risk, immediate value for documenting releases), then add semantic versioning automation (eliminates version number confusion), then implement canary deployments (reduces blast radius of issues), finally add automated rollback (fastest mean time to recovery). Attempting advanced deployment strategies (canary, blue-green) without basic automation (changelog, semver) results in complex deployment workflows with manual documentation burden. The full release automation stack typically takes 3-6 weeks to implement but eliminates 90% of release coordination overhead and reduces deployment-induced outages by catching issues in staging before production impact.
