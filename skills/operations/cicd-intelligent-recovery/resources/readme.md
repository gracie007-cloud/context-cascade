# CI/CD Intelligent Recovery Resources

Support files for pipeline stabilization and rollback drills.

- **Runbooks**: step-by-step recovery checklists and communication templates.
- **Scripts**: helpers for log capture, retry orchestration, and rollback toggles.
- **Telemetry references**: dashboards and queries to validate recovery.

Use with the SOP: apply structure-first, run adversarial validation, and record confidence ceilings for every recovery decision.
