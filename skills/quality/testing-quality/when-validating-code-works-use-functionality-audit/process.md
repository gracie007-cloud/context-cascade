# Routing Process: Functionality Audit

1. **Qualify the task** – Confirm the objective is to validate functionality; reroute otherwise.
2. **Activate guardrails** – Require reproduction steps, evidence (commands/outputs), file:line mapping, and confidence ceiling.
3. **Package context** – Collect environment details, failing scenarios, and exclusions.
4. **Hand off to `functionality-audit`** – Trigger the SOP and reference its examples/tests.
5. **Close** – Record outcomes and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – Process rewritten with Prompt Architect confidence discipline and Skill Forge structure-first routing.
