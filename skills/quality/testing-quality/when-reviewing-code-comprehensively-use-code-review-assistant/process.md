# Routing Process: Comprehensive Code Review

1. **Qualify the task** – Ensure a full-spectrum review is needed; otherwise route to the appropriate specialized skill.
2. **Activate guardrails** – Require file:line evidence, severity tagging, references, and confidence ceilings.
3. **Package context** – Collect PR link, scope, priorities, and exclusions.
4. **Hand off to `code-review-assistant`** – Trigger the SOP using its artifacts (examples/tests) for consistency.
5. **Close** – Record outcomes, blockers, and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – Process rewritten with Prompt Architect confidence discipline and Skill Forge structure-first routing.
