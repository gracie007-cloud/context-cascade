# Routing Process: Style Audit

1. **Qualify the request** – Confirm scope is style/readability/doc polish; otherwise route to the proper skill.
2. **Activate guardrails** – Remind downstream of evidence (file:line + rule/reference) and confidence ceiling requirements.
3. **Package context** – Provide changed files, priorities, exclusions, and deadlines.
4. **Hand off to `style-audit`** – Trigger the SOP and link required artifacts (examples/tests).
5. **Close the loop** – Record outcomes, waivers, and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – Process rewritten with Prompt Architect confidence discipline and Skill Forge structure-first routing.
