# Routing Process: Verification Quality

1. **Qualify the task** – Ensure the goal is verification/grounding/policy compliance; reroute otherwise.
2. **Activate guardrails** – Require constraint categorization (hard/soft/inferred), evidence mapping, and confidence ceiling.
3. **Package context** – Collect sources, policies, and target outputs.
4. **Hand off to `verification-quality`** – Trigger the SOP and reference its examples/tests.
5. **Close** – Record outcomes and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – Process rewritten using Prompt Architect confidence discipline and Skill Forge structure-first routing.
