## Overview
Dogfooding System operationalizes continuous self-application loops so every quality skill is validated, stress-tested, and improved with measurable deltas. Use this README to navigate artifacts and start a session quickly.

## Artifact Map
- `SKILL.md` – primary SOP for running dogfooding sessions and reporting confidence.
- `INDEX.md` – catalog of session types, tags, and memory namespaces.
- `examples/` – sample session transcripts and convergence reports.
- `tests/` – harnesses for regression-checking the dogfooding workflow.
- `references/` – heuristics, anti-pattern lists, and convergence metrics.
- `resources/` – helper scripts and assets for tagging/logging.
- `graphviz/` – process diagrams for the loop architecture.

## Quick Start
1. Read `SKILL.md` to activate the SOP and confidence ceiling rules.
2. Pick a target skill and success metrics from `INDEX.md`.
3. Run a self-application loop using an `examples/` pattern; record deltas and artifacts.
4. Execute at least one adversarial probe; log results in `references/`.
5. Close with a convergence summary and `Confidence: X.XX (ceiling: TYPE Y.YY)`.

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Required artifacts present; missing items queued for creation.
- [ ] Session tags applied (WHO/WHY) for recall.
- [ ] Adversarial probes executed; deltas measured.
- [ ] Confidence ceiling stated in English-only output.

Confidence: 0.70 (ceiling: inference 0.70) – README updated to follow Skill Forge structure-first guidance and Prompt Architect confidence discipline.
