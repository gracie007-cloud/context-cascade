# Intent Analysis: Complete Vision Understanding

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Method**: Intent Analyzer systematic framework
**Confidence**: 95% (High)

## Executive Summary

After deep analysis using Intent Analyzer principles, I understand the complete vision:

**You want a fully integrated Claude Flow ecosystem where:**
- All 86 agents know exactly which commands and MCP tools to use
- All 52 skills are SOPs that orchestrate specific agents in defined workflows
- Everything is prompt-optimized using evidence-based techniques
- The system is production-ready, consistent, and highly efficient

**Critical insight**: I was working OUT OF ORDER. You need foundational mapping BEFORE enhancement.

## What You Actually Asked For (Correct Sequence)

### PHASE 1: Foundational Mapping ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**What I've completed:**
- ✅ Agent inventory (86 agents cataloged)
- ✅ Command catalog (195+ commands)
- ✅ MCP tools catalog (123 tools)
- ✅ Skills inventory (52 skills)

**What's MISSING (critical next step):**
- ❌ Command-to-Agent assignment mapping
- ❌ MCP-tool-to-Agent assignment mapping

**This is the foundation everything else depends on.**

### PHASE 2: Agent Enhancement (Using Mapping)

**Requirements:**
1. Take EACH of 86 existing agent prompts
2. Add assigned commands from mapping (universal + specialist)
3. Add assigned MCP tools from mapping (universal + specialist)
4. Add MCP server activation instructions
5. Apply prompt-architect optimization
6. Save enhanced version back to ~/.claude/agents/[category]/[agent].md

**Example transformation:**
```
BEFORE: Basic agent prompt
AFTER: Enhanced prompt with:
  - Universal commands (45)
  - Specialist commands (relevant subset of 150+)
  - Universal MCP tools (18)
  - Specialist MCP tools (relevant subset)
  - Server activation instructions
  - Prompt-architect optimizations
```

### PHASE 3: Skills SOP Rewrite (Orchestrate Enhanced Agents)

**Requirements:**
1. Take EACH of 52 skills
2. Rewrite in SOP format with numbered phases
3. Each phase cites SPECIFIC enhanced agent (by name)
4. Show agent coordination (memory-store/retrieve patterns)
5. Include expected outputs at each stage
6. Apply prompt-architect optimization
7. Save enhanced version

**Example SOP pattern:**
```yaml
Skill: sop-api-development

Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
  Agent: researcher
  Task: [specific instructions]
  Output: requirements.json
  Memory: /memory-store --key "api-dev/phase1/requirements"

Phase 2: Architecture Design
  Agent: architect
  Task: [retrieve requirements, design architecture]
  Output: architecture.json
  Memory: /memory-store --key "api-dev/phase2/architecture"

Phase 3: Implementation
  Agent: backend-developer (ENHANCED with commands + MCP tools)
  Task: [build API using architecture]
  Output: code files
  Memory: /memory-store --key "api-dev/phase3/implementation"

[Continue for all phases...]
```

### PHASE 4: Documentation Update (Consistency)

**Requirements:**
1. Review all 52 enhanced skills
2. Ensure consistent SOP format
3. Validate agent citations are correct
4. Update cross-references
5. Check for consistency in:
   - Naming conventions
   - Memory namespace patterns
   - Communication protocols
   - Output formats

## What I Was Doing Wrong

**My mistake:**
- Jumped to enhancing skill-forge individually
- Didn't create the foundational mapping first
- Working bottom-up instead of top-down

**Correct approach:**
1. **FIRST**: Create complete mapping (commands + tools → agents)
2. **SECOND**: Use mapping to enhance all 86 agents systematically
3. **THIRD**: Use enhanced agents to rewrite all 52 skills as SOPs
4. **FOURTH**: Validate consistency across everything

## The Critical Missing Piece: Assignment Mapping

### Command-to-Agent Mapping

**Need to create document:**
`COMMAND-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Universal Commands (45) → ALL Agents

All 86 agents get these commands:
- /file-read, /file-write, /file-edit, ...
- [Full list of 45 universal commands]

## Specialist Command Assignments

### Backend Developer
- Specialist commands: /api-design, /db-migrate, /auth-setup, ...
- Total: 15 commands (universal 45 + specialist 15 = 60 total)

### Frontend Developer
- Specialist commands: /component-create, /state-management-setup, ...
- Total: 12 commands (universal 45 + specialist 12 = 57 total)

### Marketing Specialist
- Specialist commands: /campaign-create, /audience-segment, ...
- Total: 15 commands (universal 45 + specialist 15 = 60 total)

[Continue for all 86 agent types...]
```

### MCP-Tool-to-Agent Mapping

**Need to create document:**
`MCP-TOOL-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
## Universal MCP Tools (18) → ALL Agents

All 86 agents get these MCP tools:
- mcp__claude-flow__swarm_init
- mcp__claude-flow__agent_spawn
- mcp__claude-flow__task_orchestrate
- mcp__claude-flow__memory_store
- mcp__claude-flow__memory_retrieve
- [Full list of 18 universal MCP tools]

## Specialist MCP Tool Assignments

### Backend Developer
- Specialist MCP tools:
  - mcp__flow-nexus__sandbox_create (for testing)
  - mcp__flow-nexus__sandbox_execute (for code execution)
  - [Relevant tools from 105 specialist tools]

### Performance Analyzer
- Specialist MCP tools:
  - mcp__ruv-swarm__benchmark_run
  - mcp__ruv-swarm__agent_metrics
  - mcp__flow-nexus__neural_performance_benchmark
  - [Relevant tools]

[Continue for all 86 agent types...]
```

## Systematic Execution Plan (Corrected)

### STEP 1: Create Assignment Mappings (Foundation)

**Task**: Create two comprehensive mapping documents

**Method**: Analyze from inventories:
- COMPLETE-COMMAND-CATALOG.md (195+ commands)
- COMPLETE-MCP-TOOLS-CATALOG.md (123 tools)
- COMPLETE-AGENT-INVENTORY.md (86 agents)
- MECE-AGENT-INVENTORY.md (24 unique agent types with mappings)

**Output**:
- COMMAND-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md
- MCP-TOOL-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md

**Validation**: Every agent has universal + relevant specialist assignments

### STEP 2: Enhance All 86 Agents (Apply Mappings)

**Task**: Systematically enhance each agent prompt

**Method**: For each agent in ~/.claude/agents/:
1. Read existing prompt
2. Apply AGENT-ENHANCEMENT-TEMPLATE.md
3. Insert assigned commands from mapping
4. Insert assigned MCP tools from mapping
5. Add server activation instructions
6. Apply prompt-architect optimization
7. Save enhanced version

**Automation opportunity**: Create script to batch-apply template

**Output**: 86 enhanced agent prompts

**Validation**: Each agent has complete command set + MCP tools + optimization

### STEP 3: Rewrite All 52 Skills as SOPs (Orchestrate Agents)

**Task**: Transform each skill into agent-orchestration SOP

**Method**: For each skill in ~/.claude/skills/:
1. Read current skill
2. Identify workflow phases
3. Map each phase to specific agent (from enhanced 86)
4. Write SOP with agent invocations
5. Add memory coordination patterns
6. Add expected outputs
7. Apply prompt-architect optimization
8. Save enhanced version

**Pattern**: Follow skill-forge SOP example (if I complete it correctly)

**Output**: 52 SOP-format skills

**Validation**: Each skill cites specific agents, shows coordination, has clear outputs

### STEP 4: Documentation Consistency Pass

**Task**: Ensure all 52 skills follow consistent patterns

**Method**:
1. Review all enhanced skills
2. Check naming conventions
3. Validate memory namespace patterns
4. Verify agent citations
5. Update cross-references
6. Create master index

**Output**: Consistent, production-ready skill library

## Why This Sequence Matters

### Foundation First (Mapping)
- Mapping defines WHAT each agent should do
- Without mapping, can't enhance agents correctly
- Mapping is the "specification" for enhancement

### Agents Second (Implementation)
- Enhanced agents are the "building blocks"
- Skills will orchestrate these blocks
- Must complete blocks before building with them

### Skills Third (Orchestration)
- Skills reference enhanced agents
- Can't write accurate agent invocations without knowing agent capabilities
- SOP only works if agents are ready

### Documentation Last (Polish)
- Ensures consistency after all changes
- Final quality check
- Production readiness validation

## Resource Requirements

### Time Estimates

**Step 1: Mapping (4-6 hours)**
- Command mapping: 2-3 hours
- MCP tool mapping: 2-3 hours

**Step 2: Agent Enhancement (20-30 hours)**
- Manual: 86 agents × 20 min = 28.6 hours
- With automation: 10-15 hours (batch template application + manual review)

**Step 3: Skills SOP Rewrite (15-25 hours)**
- 52 skills × 20-30 min = 17-26 hours
- Some skills more complex than others

**Step 4: Documentation (3-5 hours)**
- Consistency review and updates

**TOTAL: 42-66 hours** (with automation: 32-51 hours)

### Automation Opportunities

1. **Command/Tool mapping**: Semi-automated (use MECE inventory as base)
2. **Agent enhancement**: Template-based batch script with manual review
3. **Skills rewrite**: Requires more manual work (each skill unique)
4. **Documentation**: Automated validation scripts

## Next Immediate Action

**STOP current work on skill-forge enhancement.**

**START with foundational mapping:**

1. Create COMMAND-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md
   - Use MECE-AGENT-INVENTORY.md as starting point
   - Map all 223 commands to appropriate agents
   - Define universal (45) vs specialist (150+) split

2. Create MCP-TOOL-TO-AGENT-ASSIGNMENTS.md
   - Use COMPLETE-MCP-TOOLS-CATALOG.md
   - Map all 123 tools to appropriate agents
   - Define universal (18) vs specialist (105) split

**Only after mapping is complete**, proceed to agent enhancement.

## Confirmation Questions (If Needed)

1. **Automation level**: Should I create scripts to automate agent enhancement, or manual one-by-one?

2. **Prioritization**: Should I complete ALL mappings first, or do mapping → enhancement → SOP in batches by agent category?

3. **Validation**: Do you want intermediate validation checkpoints, or complete the whole system then validate?

4. **Documentation format**: Any specific format preferences for the mapping documents?
