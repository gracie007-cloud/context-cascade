## Key Principles

### 1. Agent Specialization
Each agent has **deeply embedded domain knowledge**:
- Not "helpful assistant that can do X"
- But "Senior X Specialist with precision-level understanding of Y, Z, and W"

### 2. Command Delegation
Clear separation of responsibilities:
- **Universal Commands** (46): Any agent can use (file ops, git, communication, memory, coordination, testing)
- **Specialist Commands** (50+): Delegated to domain experts only (marketing campaigns, security audits, ML model training, etc.)

### 3. Sequential + Parallel Orchestration
Agents work together efficiently:
- **Sequential**: When Agent B needs Agent A's output (research → strategy → execution)
- **Parallel**: When agents work independently (backend + frontend + mobile development)

### 4. Business-First Architecture
Technology serves business objectives:
- Not "here's what our tech stack can do"
- But "here's how to grow revenue, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction"

### 5. Evidence-Based Reasoning
All agents use cognitive frameworks:
- **Self-Consistency**: Validate from multiple angles
- **Program-of-Thought**: Decompose before execution
- **Plan-and-Solve**: Explicit planning with validation gates
