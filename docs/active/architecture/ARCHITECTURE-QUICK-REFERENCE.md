# Skill→Agent→Command Architecture - Quick Reference

**Document Version**: 1.0.0  
**Purpose**: Fast lookup guide for architecture concepts  
**Audience**: Developers, architects, AI engineers  

---

## 1. What Is This Architecture?

A **three-layer plugin system** for AI-assisted software development:

```
COMMANDS (223)           User interface (slash commands)
    ↓ bind to
SKILLS (183)              Methodology layer (how to solve problems)
    ↓ delegate to
AGENTS (211)             Expertise layer (who solves them)
    ↓ coordinated by
MEMORY MCP + HOOKS       Persistence & automation
```

**Key Innovation**: Theater detection via 6-agent Byzantine consensus validates real implementation vs fake.

---

## 2. Three Layers Explained

### Layer 1: SKILLS (93 total)

**What**: High-level frameworks for solving specific problems  
**Where**: `skills/` directory  
**Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`SKILL.md`)

**Key Skills**:
- `feature-dev-complete` - 12-stage feature development
- `research-driven-planning` - Loop 1: Planning with risk analysis
- `parallel-swarm-implementation` - Loop 2: Multi-agent execution
- `cicd-intelligent-recovery` - Loop 3: Quality & failure recovery
- `code-review-assistant` - Multi-agent PR reviews
- `theater-detection-audit` - 6-agent consensus validation
- `agent-creator` - 4-phase SOP for creating agents

**How to Find Skills**:
```bash
# Central registry
docs/MASTER-SKILLS-INDEX.md       # All 93 skills
skills/THREE-LOOP-INTEGRATION-*.md  # Three-loop architecture
skills/CREATION_SUMMARY.md          # Recent additions
```

### Layer 2: AGENTS (131 total)

**What**: Specialized AI agents with distinct expertise  
**Where**: `agents/` directory  
**Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`{agent}.md`)

**Agent Categories**:
| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Core Development | 8 | coder, reviewer, tester, researcher, planner |
| Testing & Validation | 9 | e2e-testing, security-testing, perf-testing |
| Frontend | 6 | react-dev, vue-dev, ui-builder |
| Database | 7 | db-design, query-optimizer, cache-strategist |
| Coordination | 15 | hierarchical, mesh, adaptive, byzantine |
| GitHub | 9 | pr-manager, release-manager, issue-tracker |
| Specialized | 12+ | backend-dev, ml-developer, cicd-engineer |

**5 Specialist Types** (use these, NOT "general-purpose"):
- `researcher` - Analyze, research, investigate
- `coder` - Build, implement, create, fix
- `analyst` - Review, test, audit, validate
- `optimizer` - Optimize, improve, tune, benchmark
- `coordinator` - Orchestrate, coordinate, manage, delegate

### Layer 3: COMMANDS (224 total)

**What**: User-facing slash commands  
**Where**: `commands/` directory  
**Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter  

**Command Categories** (MECE):
| Domain | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Development Workflow | 67 |
| Quality & Validation | 29 |
| Agent Lifecycle | 18 |
| Memory & State | 18 |
| Monitoring & Telemetry | 18 |
| Performance & Optimization | 18 |
| Integration & External | 21 |
| Research & Analysis | 20 |
| Automation & Hooks | 22 |
| Core Infrastructure | 3 |

**Essential Commands**:
- `/build-feature` - 12-stage feature development
- `/review-pr` - Multi-agent PR review
- `/fix-bug` - Smart bug fixing with root cause analysis
- `/quick-check` - Lightning-fast quality check
- `/sparc` - SPARC methodology execution

---

## 3. How Data Flows Through Layers

### Simple Flow: Command → Skill → Agents

```
User Input:
  /build-feature "user authentication"
         ↓
Parse YAML frontmatter:
  name: build-feature
  binding: skill:feature-dev-complete
         ↓
Load Skill: feature-dev-complete
  agents: [researcher, coder, tester, analyst, optimizer, coordinator]
  12 phases defined
         ↓
Spawn Agents (Claude Code Task tool):
  Task("researcher", "Phase 1: Research", "researcher")
  Task("coder", "Phase 3: Design", "coder")
  Task("coder", "Phase 5: Implement", "coder")
  ... (all in one message for parallelism)
         ↓
Pre-Hooks Execute:
  - Auto-assign agents by file type
  - Validate commands
  - Load context
         ↓
Agents Execute Skill Phases (parallel):
  Each agent runs its phases, stores results in memory
         ↓
Post-Hooks Execute:
  - Format code
  - Train neural patterns
  - Update memory
  - Track metrics
         ↓
User Gets Output:
  ✅ Feature complete, tests passing, PR ready
```

### Parallel Execution: Multi-Agent Review

```
/review-pr 123
         ↓
5 Agents Spawn Simultaneously:
  Task(analyst, "Security review", "analyst")
  Task(optimizer, "Performance review", "optimizer")
  Task(analyst, "Style review", "analyst")
  Task(analyst, "Test review", "analyst")
  Task(analyst, "Documentation review", "analyst")
         ↓
All 4 Execute in Parallel:
  Security → 95/100
  Performance → 88/100
  Style → 90/100
  Tests → 82/100
  Documentation → 85/100
         ↓
Adaptive Coordinator Aggregates:
  Final Score: 88/100
  Decision: APPROVE
  Post comment with all findings
```

---

## 4. Memory MCP Integration

### Pattern: WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY Tagging

Every memory write includes metadata:

```javascript
memory_store(
  key: "swarm/coder/implementation",
  value: { code, decisions, ... },
  tags: {
    WHO: {
      agent: "coder",
      category: "code-quality",
      capabilities: ["code-gen", "optimization"]
    },
    WHEN: {
      iso: "2025-11-06T10:30:00Z",
      unix: 1730875800,
      readable: "Nov 6, 2025 10:30"
    },
    PROJECT: "user-authentication",
    WHY: "implementation"  // implementation|bugfix|refactor|testing|documentation|analysis|planning|research
  }
)
```

### Memory Retrieval: Semantic Search

```javascript
memory_search(
  pattern: "swarm/*/auth*",
  query: "JWT token refresh strategy"
) 
→ Returns top 5-20 semantic matches ranked by relevance
```

### Retention Tiers

- **24 hours** - Current session context, active decisions
- **7 days** - Completed features, session summaries, patterns
- **30+ days** - Historical failures, architecture decisions, lessons learned

---

## 5. Three-Loop Integration

### Loop 1: Planning (research-driven-planning)

```
Input: User specification
       ↓
Step 1: Research (Gemini Search)
        Evidence-based findings
       ↓
Step 2: Planning (MECE breakdown)
        Task division
       ↓
Step 3: Pre-Mortem (5x risk analysis)
        Identify risks & mitigation
       ↓
Output: loop1-planning-package.json
        Memory: integration/loop1-to-loop2
```

### Loop 2: Implementation (parallel-swarm-implementation)

```
Input: Planning package from Loop 1
       ↓
Step 1: Discovery & Initialization
Step 2: MECE task division
Step 3: Multi-agent swarm deployment
Step 4: Theater detection (6-agent consensus)
Step 5: Integration & validation
       ↓
Output: loop2-delivery-package.json
        (code, tests, theater audit, metrics)
        Memory: integration/loop2-to-loop3
```

### Loop 3: CI/CD Quality (cicd-intelligent-recovery)

```
Input: Delivery package from Loop 2
       ↓
Step 1: GitHub hooks trigger
Step 2: Test failures analysis
Step 3: Root cause detection
Step 4: Intelligent fixes (Codex)
Step 5: Validation re-testing
       ↓
Output: loop3-failure-patterns.json
        (what failed, why, prevention strategies)
        Memory: integration/loop3-feedback
        
        ↓ FEEDBACK
        
Next iteration's Loop 1 loads historical failures
        ↓
Better planning due to real failure data
        ↓
Better implementation
        ↓
Better quality
```

## 6. Golden Rules & Best Practices

### GOLDEN RULE
```
1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS

Mandatory patterns:
- TodoWrite: Batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ minimum)
- Task Tool: Spawn ALL agents in ONE message
- File Ops: Batch ALL reads/writes in ONE message
- Bash Cmds: Batch ALL terminal ops in ONE message
- Memory Ops: Batch ALL store/retrieve in ONE message
```

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

```
User says "analyze"     → researcher
User says "build"       → coder
User says "review"      → analyst
User says "optimize"    → optimizer
User says "manage"      → coordinator

WRONG: "general-purpose", "developer", "agent"
RIGHT: "researcher", "coder", "analyst", "optimizer", "coordinator"
```

### Access Control Rules

```
CODE QUALITY AGENTS (211):
├─ coder, reviewer, tester, analyst, code-analyzer
├─ functionality-audit, theater-detection-audit
├─ production-validator, sparc-coder, backend-dev
├─ mobile-dev, ml-developer, base-template-generator
└─ code-review-swarm
Can Access: memory-mcp, connascence-analyzer, claude-flow

PLANNING AGENTS (211):
├─ planner, researcher, system-architect, specification
├─ pseudocode, architecture, refinement
├─ hierarchical-coordinator, mesh-coordinator, adaptive-coordinator
├─ byzantine-coordinator, raft-manager, gossip-coordinator
└─ consensus-builder, crdt-synchronizer, quorum-manager, [more]
Can Access: memory-mcp, claude-flow (NO connascence-analyzer)
```

### File Organization

```
DO:
✅ /src - Source code
✅ /tests - Test files
✅ /docs - Documentation
✅ /config - Configuration
✅ /scripts - Utility scripts

DON'T:
❌ Save working files to root folder
❌ Mix documentation and code
❌ Put tests in source directories (separate /tests folder)
```

## 10. Theater Detection - Key Concept

**Problem**: How to verify code actually works (not just looks good)?

**Solution**: 6-Agent Byzantine Consensus

```
6 agents test implementation independently:
1. Sandbox execution test      → ✅ Runs without errors
2. Coverage validation         → ✅ 95% coverage
3. Mock detection             → ✅ No fake implementations
4. Integration test           → ✅ All parts work together
5. Performance benchmark      → ✅ Performance acceptable
6. Security validation        → ✅ No vulnerabilities

CONSENSUS (≥5/6 pass):
✅ REAL IMPLEMENTATION

CONSENSUS (≤4/6 pass):
❌ THEATER DETECTED - Needs investigation
```

**Skill**: `theater-detection-audit`  
**Reference**: `commands/audit-commands/theater-detect.md`

---

## 11. Memory Storage Examples

### Example 1: Store Implementation Decision

```javascript
memory_store(
  key: "swarm/feature-dev/auth-jwt-decision",
  value: {
    decision: "Use JWT with refresh tokens",
    rationale: "Stateless, scalable, industry standard",
    tradeoffs: ["need refresh token rotation", "token expiry handling"],
    alternatives: ["session-based", "OAuth 2.0"],
    rejected: ["session-based due to database dependency"]
  },
  tags: {
    WHO: { agent: "researcher", category: "planning" },
    WHEN: { iso: "2025-11-06T10:30:00Z" },
    PROJECT: "user-authentication",
    WHY: "planning"
  }
)
```

### Example 2: Retrieve Similar Decisions

```javascript
memory_search(
  pattern: "swarm/*/auth*",
  query: "JWT authentication implementation strategy"
)
→ Returns: Top 5-20 semantic matches with ranking
   1. Previous JWT decision (95% match)
   2. OAuth2 vs JWT comparison (87% match)
   3. Token refresh patterns (82% match)
   ...
```

### Example 3: Load Historical Failures

```javascript
memory_search(
  pattern: "integration/loop3-feedback/*",
  query: "async race condition bugs"
)
→ Returns: All documented async failures
   Pattern: race-condition
   Frequency: 3 occurrences
   Root causes: concurrent requests, shared state
   Prevention: mutex locks, request queueing
```

---

## 12. Execution Examples

  Performance: 88/100 ✅
  Style: 90/100 ✅
  Tests: 82/100 ✅
  Docs: 85/100 ✅
Merge Ready: ✅ Yes
```

### Example 3: Theater Detection (Consensus)

```bash
/quick-check src/auth.js

Expected Output:
6-Agent Byzantine Consensus:
  Agent 1 (Sandbox):      ✅ Real
  Agent 2 (Coverage):     ✅ 95%
  Agent 3 (Mocks):        ✅ None detected
  Agent 4 (Integration):  ✅ Works
  Agent 5 (Performance):  ✅ Fast
  Agent 6 (Security):     ✅ Secure

CONSENSUS (6/6 pass):
✅ REAL IMPLEMENTATION (100% confidence)
```

## 13. Troubleshooting Quick Guide

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Command won't execute | Check skill binding in command YAML |
| Agent seems confused | Verify agent has required MCP server access |
| Memory operation fails | Ensure WHO/WHEN/PROJECT/WHY tags included |
| Agents not coordinating | Check coordination hooks in settings.json |
| Theater detection fails | May indicate real implementation issue |
| Performance problems | Run `/profiler-start` then `/profiler-stop` |
| Test coverage low | Review `functionality-audit` results |
| Slow multi-agent execution | Verify parallel Task tool usage (1 message) |

---

## 14. Key Metrics & Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Agent |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Code Quality | ≥80/100 | code-analyzer |
| Test Coverage | ≥90% | tester |

MEMORY + HOOKS (persistence & automation)
```

**Key principles**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ 131 specialized agents with distinct expertise
- ✅ 93 reusable skills covering all domains
- ✅ 223 commands for granular control
- ✅ Persistent memory with semantic search
- ✅ Theater detection via Byzantine consensus
- ✅ Three-loop feedback for continuous improvement
- ✅ Parallel execution with adaptive coordination

**Central command**: 
```
GOLDEN RULE: 1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS
```

Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agents, batch all operations together, and leverage memory for cross-session learning.
