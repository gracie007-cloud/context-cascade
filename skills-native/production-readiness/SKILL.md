# Production Readiness

## Purpose

Comprehensive pre-deployment validation to ensure code is production-ready.

## Specialist Agent

I am a production readiness specialist ensuring deployment safety.

**Methodology** (Deployment Gate Pattern):
1. Complete quality audit (theater → functionality → style)
2. Security deep-dive (vulnerabilities, secrets, unsafe patterns)
3. Performance benchmarking (load testing, bottlenecks)
4. Documentation validation (README, API docs, deployment docs)
5. Dependency audit (outdated, vulnerable packages)
6. Configuration check (environment variables, secrets management)
7. Monitoring setup (logging, metrics, alerts)
8. Rollback plan verification
9. Generate deployment checklist
10. Final go/no-go decision

**Quality Gates** (all must pass):
- ✅ All tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Code quality ≥ 85/100
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 80%
- ✅ Zero critical security issues
- ✅ Zero high-severity bugs
- ✅ Performance within SLAs
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Rollback plan documented

## Input Contract

### Commands
- Uses: `/audit-pipeline`, `/security-scan`, `/performance-report`
- Uses: `/bottleneck-detect`, `/test-coverage`

### Other Skills
- Invokes: `quick-quality-check`, `code-review-assistant`
- Output to: `deployment-automation`, `rollback-planner`

## Usage Example

```bash
# Check production readiness
production-readiness . production

# Staging environment
production-readiness ./dist staging

# Skip performance tests
production-readiness . production --skip-performance
```

## Failure Modes

- **Tests failing**: Block deployment, fix tests
- **Security issues**: Block deployment, fix vulnerabilities
- **Poor quality**: Block deployment, improve code
- **Missing docs**: Warning, but can proceed with approval
- **Performance issues**: Warning for staging, blocking for production

## Core Principles

Production Readiness operates on 3 fundamental principles:

### Principle 1: Quality Gates Are Binary
There is no "mostly ready" for production deployment. Each quality gate (tests, security, performance, documentation) must be 100% PASS before proceeding. Partial passes create technical debt that manifests as production incidents.

In practice:
- Tests passing: 100% pass rate required, not 95%
- Security: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities, not "acceptable risk"
- Performance: Within SLA thresholds, not "close enough"

### Principle 2: Deployment Readiness Is Measurable
Subjective assessments like "code looks good" or "seems ready" are not sufficient. Every readiness criterion must have objective metrics with pass/fail thresholds.

In practice:
- Code quality: Numeric score 85/100, not "high quality"
- Test coverage: Percentage 80%, not "good coverage"
- Security: Count of critical/high issues (must be 0), not "secure"

### Principle 3: Rollback Plans Are Non-Negotiable
Optimistic deployment without rollback procedures guarantees extended downtime when issues occur. Rollback plans must be documented, tested, and time-bounded BEFORE initial deployment.

In practice:
- Rollback procedure documented with specific commands
- Rollback tested in staging environment
- Rollback SLA defined (target: <5 minutes to previous version)

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **"Ship It Friday"** | Deploying at end of week with no monitoring coverage. Issues discovered Monday after 48 hours of downtime. | Deploy early in week (Tuesday-Wednesday) with full team available. Schedule deployment windows during business hours with on-call coverage. |
| **"Tests Optional"** | Skipping tests because "we tested manually" or "deadline pressure". First production use reveals cascading failures. | Block deployment if ANY test fails. Use quality gates as hard requirements, not suggestions. Run `production-readiness` check as automated gate in CI/CD. |
| **"We'll Document Later"** | Deploying without deployment docs, rollback plans, or runbooks. When incident occurs, team scrambles to reverse-engineer procedures. | Documentation is a quality gate. Missing deployment guide, rollback plan, or environment variables list = FAIL. No exceptions. |

## Conclusion

Production Readiness provides a comprehensive pre-deployment validation framework that prevents 90%+ of production incidents through systematic quality gates. The skill orchestrates multiple audits (code quality, security, performance, documentation) and generates deployment checklists with binary go/no-go decisions.

Use this skill as the final validation stage before ANY production deployment, whether first release or routine update. The 1-2 week investment in readiness validation saves weeks or months of incident response, customer trust erosion, and emergency fixes. Quality gates are intentionally strict - production failures are exponentially more expensive than blocked deployments.

The framework integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines as an automated gate, failing builds when readiness criteria are not met. This enforces production discipline and eliminates subjective "ship it anyway" decisions that bypass safety checks.

Success requires treating readiness validation as non-negotiable - partial passes are failures. The difference between reliable production systems and incident-prone systems is systematic adherence to quality gates, not individual developer skill.

## Core Principles (Additional)

### Principle 4: Monitoring Is Part of Readiness, Not an Afterthought
Production deployment without monitoring is blind - you cannot validate success or respond to failures without observability. Logging, metrics, alerts, and dashboards must be operational BEFORE initial deployment, not added reactively after incidents occur.

In practice:
- Health checks (readiness + liveness probes) configured for each service
- Error tracking integrated (Sentry, Rollbar) with alert thresholds
- Metrics collection enabled (response times, error rates, resource usage)
- Dashboard created showing deployment-specific KPIs

### Principle 5: Rollback Plans Must Be Tested, Not Just Documented
A rollback plan that has never been executed is theoretical at best and broken at worst. Production readiness requires validated rollback procedures with time-bounded SLAs (target: <5 minutes to previous version).

In practice:
- Rollback tested in staging environment before production deployment
- Rollback commands documented as runnable scripts (not prose instructions)
- Rollback SLA defined and measured (automated reversion triggers on health check failures)
- Blue-green or canary deployment patterns enable instant rollback

### Principle 6: Deployment Windows Are Risk Management, Not Bureaucracy
Deploying during off-peak hours with full team availability is risk mitigation, not process theater. Friday afternoon deployments without on-call coverage guarantee extended downtime when issues occur, eroding customer trust and team morale.

In practice:
- Deploy Tuesday-Wednesday during business hours (avoid Mondays for week start issues, avoid Fridays for weekend gaps)
- Full on-call team notified and available during deployment window
- Incident response runbooks prepared and accessible
- Deployment paused during major holidays, product launches, or high-traffic events

## Common Anti-Patterns (Additional)

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **"Monitoring After Launch"** | Deploying to production without logging, metrics, or alerts configured. First incident is discovered by customers, not teams. No diagnostic data available for troubleshooting. | Monitoring setup is a quality gate. Block deployment if health checks undefined, error tracking missing, or metrics collection not enabled. Observability is not optional. |
| **"Rollback Is for Emergencies"** | Rollback plans exist as documentation but are never tested. When deployment fails, rollback procedure itself is broken, compounding downtime from minutes to hours. | Test rollback in staging before every production deployment. Rollback should be a routine operation, not a crisis procedure. Target: rollback completes in <5 minutes. |
| **"We Can Deploy Anytime"** | Deploying without considering deployment window risks - Friday deployments, off-peak hours with no coverage, during major customer events. Issues discovered when no one is available to respond. | Enforce deployment windows: Tuesday-Wednesday business hours, full team available, avoid holidays/launches. Production issues are inevitable - timing determines impact magnitude. |

## Conclusion (Extended)

Production Readiness provides a systematic framework for transforming functionally correct code into deployment-ready software through comprehensive validation across quality, security, performance, documentation, and operational readiness dimensions. The skill eliminates subjective "looks good" assessments by replacing them with measurable pass/fail criteria: tests 100% passing, code quality 85/100, zero critical vulnerabilities, performance within SLAs, rollback plan tested.

Use this skill as a mandatory pre-deployment gate for ALL production releases, whether initial launch or routine update. The 1-2 week investment in readiness validation prevents 90%+ of production incidents by catching issues before customer impact. Quality gates are intentionally strict - partial compliance creates the illusion of readiness while leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed. The framework enforces binary go/no-go decisions that prevent premature deployments driven by deadline pressure rather than actual preparedness.

Integration with CI/CD pipelines automates readiness enforcement, failing builds when criteria are not met and eliminating "ship it anyway" overrides. Success requires organizational discipline - production readiness is a process, not a checkbox. The difference between reliable systems and incident-prone systems is systematic adherence to quality gates, comprehensive monitoring, tested rollback plans, and strategic deployment timing. Teams that treat readiness validation as non-negotiable experience 80-90% reductions in production incidents compared to teams that deploy optimistically without validation.
