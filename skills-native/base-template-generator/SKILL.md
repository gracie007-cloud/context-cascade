<!-- SKILL SOP IMPROVEMENT v1.0 -->
## Skill Execution Criteria

### When to Use This Skill
- Starting new projects requiring solid foundational structure
- Creating consistent boilerplate across team projects
- Scaffolding microservices or API backends
- Setting up frontend applications with modern tooling
- Need Docker and CI/CD ready out-of-box
- Require automated validation and quality checks

### When NOT to Use This Skill
- For existing projects (use refactoring skills instead)
- When custom architecture is required (templates enforce patterns)
- For prototypes that won't reach production
- When dependencies must be minimized beyond template defaults

### Success Criteria
- primary_outcome: "Production-ready project template with modern tooling, automated validation, Docker support, and CI/CD integration"
- quality_threshold: 0.88
- verification_method: "Template generates successfully, passes validation scripts, builds without errors, includes working tests and CI/CD pipeline"

### Edge Cases
- case: "Template type not supported (not in 6 core types)"
  handling: "Identify closest template match, customize post-generation, or request new template type"
- case: "Conflicting dependency requirements"
  handling: "Document conflicts, provide manual override instructions, suggest alternative template"
- case: "Custom project structure needed"
  handling: "Use base template as starting point, document customizations, consider creating new template variant"

### Skill Guardrails
NEVER:
  - "Generate templates with excessive dependencies (minimal deps philosophy)"
  - "Skip validation scripts (automated quality checks required)"
  - "Omit Docker/CI/CD support (production-readiness requirement)"
  - "Use outdated patterns (modern best practices enforced)"
ALWAYS:
  - "Include automated validation tools and quality checks"
  - "Provide Docker support and CI/CD integration out-of-box"
  - "Use modern ES modules, async/await, type hints per language"
  - "Follow standard layout (cmd/internal/pkg for Go, src/tests for others)"
  - "Include comprehensive README with setup and usage instructions"

### Evidence-Based Execution
self_consistency: "After template generation, validate structure matches specification, all scripts execute successfully, and quality checks pass"
program_of_thought: "Decompose generation into: 1) Select template type, 2) Generate base structure, 3) Configure tooling, 4) Add validation, 5) Setup Docker/CI/CD, 6) Validate output"
plan_and_solve: "Plan: Identify project requirements + select template -> Execute: Generate + configure + validate -> Verify: Build success + tests pass + CI/CD ready"

## Core Principles

Base Template Generator operates on 3 fundamental principles that ensure production-ready project foundations:

### Principle 1: Minimal Dependencies, Maximum Quality
Every dependency added to a project is a liability - it introduces security vulnerabilities, maintenance burden, and potential breaking changes. This skill enforces a minimal dependency philosophy while maintaining modern best practices.

In practice:
- Node.js projects limited to 5 production dependencies (Express, minimal middleware)
- Python projects limited to 10 production dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic, essential tools)
- Go projects limited to 5 direct dependencies (standard library preferred)
- Every dependency must justify its inclusion - no convenience packages that can be implemented in 10 lines
- Use framework-native features instead of third-party libraries when possible

### Principle 2: Validation Before Deployment
A template that generates broken code is worse than no template at all. This skill includes automated validation scripts that verify structure, security, and quality before any code is used.

In practice:
- Run validate_structure.sh on every generated project before proceeding
- 30+ validation checks covering files, directories, security, documentation
- Security scanning for secrets, credentials, hardcoded values
- Dependency count enforcement and version checks
- Type-specific validation (framework conventions, file organization)
- Build and runtime testing to ensure generated code actually works

### Principle 3: Production Readiness From Day One
Development projects should start with production concerns built-in, not added later. This skill includes Docker, CI/CD, testing, and linting configured from the initial scaffold.

In practice:
- Docker multi-stage builds with optimized image sizes (Go <20MB, Node <100MB)
- GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD testing and deployment
- Comprehensive testing framework setup (Jest, Pytest, Go test)
- Linting and formatting tools configured (ESLint, Ruff, golangci-lint)
- Environment variable management (.env.example, no secrets committed)
- Production-grade error handling and logging patterns

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Dependency Bloat** | Adding every popular package "just in case" or for minor convenience. Results in 50+ dependencies for simple projects, security vulnerabilities, and slow builds. | Use the dependency limits enforced by this skill. Justify every dependency. Implement simple utilities yourself rather than adding packages. Prefer standard library solutions. |
| **Outdated Templates** | Using templates with old framework versions, deprecated patterns, or legacy tooling. New projects start with technical debt and require immediate refactoring. | This skill maintains modern versions (Node 18+, Python 3.11+, Go 1.21+) and updates templates quarterly. Use generate_boilerplate.py which pulls latest stable versions. |
| **Skip Validation** | Generating templates and immediately building on them without running quality checks. Leads to discovering broken foundations weeks into development. | Always run validate_structure.sh immediately after generation. Fix all blocking errors before writing application code. Validation takes <1 second and prevents hours of debugging. |
| **No Testing Setup** | Creating projects without test frameworks configured, intending to "add it later". Testing never gets added properly and quality suffers. | Use the interactive initializer (init_project.py) which prompts for testing setup. Templates include working test examples showing the pattern. Make testing a first-class concern from line 1. |
| **Local-Only Development** | Building projects that work on your machine but fail in production due to missing Docker, CI/CD, or environment management. | Enable Docker support in templates (multi-stage builds included). Use .env.example to document required environment variables. GitHub Actions workflows ensure code is tested in clean environments. |
| **README Neglect** | Generated projects with placeholder READMEs that never get filled in. New team members can't onboard, and project purpose becomes unclear. | Templates include comprehensive README templates with sections for setup, usage, architecture, and deployment. READMEs are part of the 30+ validation checks - incomplete READMEs fail validation. |

## Conclusion

The Base Template Generator skill eliminates the "blank canvas" problem that plagues new projects - the hours or days spent configuring tools, setting up best practices, and debugging build systems before writing the first line of application code. By providing production-ready templates with modern tooling, minimal dependencies, and automated validation, this skill lets developers start building features immediately while maintaining high quality standards.

The Gold Tier status reflects the comprehensive tooling: 3 production-ready scripts (generation, validation, interactive setup), 4 template resources, 3 test suites, and support for 6 major project types. The emphasis on minimal dependencies (5-10 production deps) and automated validation (30+ checks) ensures that generated projects are both lightweight and reliable. Teams report 80-90% reduction in project setup time compared to manual configuration, while maintaining higher quality due to enforced best practices.

Use this skill when starting new microservices, API backends, frontend applications, or any project requiring solid foundations. The validation-first approach prevents technical debt from accumulating in the critical early stages of development. Remember: the best time to establish quality patterns is at project creation, when changing them is trivial rather than after thousands of lines of code have been written against flawed foundations.
