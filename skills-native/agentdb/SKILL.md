## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Local-only operations with no vector search needs
- Simple key-value storage without semantic similarity
- Real-time streaming data without persistence requirements
- Operations that do not require embedding-based retrieval

## Success Criteria

- Vector search query latency: <10ms for 99th percentile
- Embedding generation: <100ms per document
- Index build time: <1s per 1000 vectors
- Recall@10: >0.95 for similar documents
- Database connection success rate: >99.9%
- Memory footprint: <2GB for 1M vectors with quantization

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **Rate Limits**: AgentDB local instances have no rate limits; cloud deployments may vary
- **Connection Failures**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 retries)
- **Index Corruption**: Maintain backup indices; rebuild from source if corrupted
- **Memory Overflow**: Use quantization (4-bit, 8-bit) to reduce memory by 4-32x
- **Stale Embeddings**: Implement TTL-based refresh for dynamic content
- **Dimension Mismatch**: Validate embedding dimensions (384 for sentence-transformers) before insertion

## Guardrails & Safety

- NEVER expose database connection strings in logs or error messages
- ALWAYS validate vector dimensions before insertion
- ALWAYS sanitize metadata to prevent injection attacks
- NEVER store PII in vector metadata without encryption
- ALWAYS implement access control for multi-tenant deployments
- ALWAYS validate search results before returning to users

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify database health: Check connection status and index integrity
- Validate search quality: Measure recall/precision on test queries
- Monitor performance: Track query latency, throughput, and memory usage
- Test failure recovery: Simulate connection drops and index corruption
- Benchmark improvements: Compare against baseline metrics (e.g., 150x speedup claim)


# AgentDB - Vector Search & Semantic Memory

Ultra-fast vector database for AI agent memory, RAG systems, and semantic search applications.

## When to Use This Skill

Use when implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), building semantic search engines, creating persistent agent memory systems, or optimizing vector similarity searches for production workloads.

## Core Capabilities

### Vector Search
- 150x faster than traditional databases
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing
- 384-dimensional sentence embeddings
- Sub-millisecond query latency

### Semantic Memory
- Persistent cross-session storage
- Automatic embedding generation
- Similarity-based retrieval
- Metadata filtering and ranking

### Memory Patterns
- Short-term: Recent context (1-100 items)
- Long-term: Persistent knowledge (unlimited)
- Episodic: Timestamped experiences
- Semantic: Concept relationships

## Process

1. **Initialize vector store**
   - Configure embedding model (sentence-transformers)
   - Set up HNSW index parameters
   - Define metadata schema
   - Allocate storage backend

2. **Store information**
   - Generate embeddings automatically
   - Store with metadata tags
   - Index for fast retrieval
   - Maintain consistency

3. **Query semantically**
   - Embed query text
   - Perform vector similarity search
   - Apply metadata filters
   - Rank and return results

4. **Optimize performance**
   - Tune HNSW parameters (M, ef_construction)
   - Implement quantization (4-32x memory reduction)
   - Use batched operations
   - Monitor query latency

## Integration

- **Memory-MCP**: Triple-layer retention (24h/7d/30d+)
- **RAG Pipelines**: Document retrieval for LLM context
- **Agent Memory**: Cross-session state persistence
- **Knowledge Bases**: Semantic search for documentation

## Core Principles

AgentDB operates on 3 fundamental principles:

### Principle 1: HNSW-Accelerated Vector Similarity
Hierarchical Navigable Small World indexing provides 150x faster vector search than brute-force approaches through graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search.

In practice:
- Configure HNSW parameters (M=16, ef_construction=200) for optimal speed/accuracy tradeoff
- Accept approximate results (recall@10 >0.95) for sub-millisecond query latency
- Use exact search only when 100% recall is required and latency is not critical
- Rebuild indices periodically as data distribution changes

### Principle 2: Embedding-First Storage Architecture
All data stores as 384-dimensional sentence-transformer embeddings, enabling semantic similarity search without keyword matching.

In practice:
- Generate embeddings automatically during insertion (no manual vectorization)
- Store metadata alongside vectors for filtering and ranking
- Query by semantic meaning, not exact text matches
- Handle synonym variation, paraphrasing, and concept similarity naturally

### Principle 3: Quantization-Enabled Memory Efficiency
Vector quantization reduces memory footprint by 4-32x with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling million-scale deployments.

In practice:
- Use scalar quantization (4x reduction) for production RAG systems
- Apply binary quantization (32x reduction) for large-scale retrieval where approximate results suffice
- Maintain full-precision vectors for critical accuracy requirements
- Monitor recall degradation when enabling quantization

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Keyword-Based Filtering** | Treating vector search like SQL WHERE clauses ignores semantic similarity | Use metadata filters for exact matches, semantic search for concept retrieval |
| **Full-Precision Everything** | Storing unquantized vectors wastes memory and limits scale | Enable scalar quantization by default; use binary for >1M vectors |
| **Ignoring Dimension Mismatch** | Inserting vectors with wrong dimensions corrupts index and causes query failures | Validate embedding dimensions (384 for sentence-transformers) before insertion |
| **No Index Rebuilding** | Stale HNSW indices degrade performance as data distribution shifts | Rebuild indices monthly or after 10%+ data changes |
| **Unbounded Result Sets** | Returning all similar vectors exhausts memory and provides low-quality matches | Always set k (top-k results) and similarity thresholds |

## Conclusion

The AgentDB skill provides production-grade vector search infrastructure for AI agent memory and RAG systems. By combining HNSW indexing, sentence embeddings, and quantization, it delivers 150x faster search with 4-32x memory reduction compared to traditional databases.

Use this skill when implementing retrieval-augmented generation, building semantic search engines, or creating persistent agent memory systems. AgentDB excels at similarity search over large document corpora, cross-session agent state persistence, and real-time embedding-based retrieval where sub-millisecond latency matters.

Key takeaways: Trust HNSW for approximate search (exact results rarely needed), enable quantization for memory efficiency, and validate embeddings before insertion. The integration with Memory-MCP, ReasoningBank, and 9 reinforcement learning algorithms provides a complete memory and learning infrastructure for stateful AI agents.
