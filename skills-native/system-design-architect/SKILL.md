# System Design Architect

A comprehensive system design skill using the organism-based mental model: systems are living creatures with organs, circulation, immune systems, and survival mechanisms.

## SKILL-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### When to Use This Skill

- Designing new systems from scratch
- System design interviews (FAANG-level)
- Architecture reviews and evolution planning
- Scaling existing systems (10x, 100x)
- Production readiness assessments
- Identifying and removing SPOFs

### When NOT to Use This Skill

- Simple CRUD applications with no scale needs
- Prototypes where architecture doesn't matter yet
- When requirements are completely undefined
- Premature optimization scenarios

### Success Criteria

- Clear non-negotiable invariants defined
- All SPOFs identified and mitigated
- Decision trees applied for each component choice
- Trade-offs explicitly documented
- 90-second narrative can explain the design

## Phase 0: Pin the Target Before Drawing Boxes

**You are designing for constraints, not for tech.**

### Constraint Extraction Checklist

| Constraint | Questions to Ask |
|------------|------------------|
| **Users & Usage** | DAU/MAU? Peak QPS? Read/write ratio? Payload sizes? |
| **Latency Target** | p50/p95/p99? Mobile vs desktop? Global vs local? |
| **Availability** | SLO (99.9? 99.99?)? RTO/RPO? |
| **Consistency** | Strong vs eventual? Where does correctness matter? |
| **Data Shape** | Relational? Document? Graph? Hot keys? |
| **Security** | Auth model? Threat surface? Compliance? |
| **Growth Path** | What changes if traffic 10x? 100x? |

### What I'm Thinking as a Designer

"What are the non-negotiable invariants?"

Examples:
- "No double-charging" (payments)
- "Messages never delivered out of order per conversation" (chat)
- "Inventory can't go negative" (e-commerce)
- "Tokens must be revocable" (auth)

---

## Phase 1: Baseline Single-Server Organism

Start with a simple diagram you can explain in 30 seconds:

```
Domain -> DNS -> Server IP
Client -> HTTPS -> Server
Server -> Business Logic -> DB -> Response
```

This sets a clean foundation to EVOLVE from, instead of prematurely microservicing.

---

## Phase 2: First Evolution - Split Tiers

Split into:
- **Web/App Tier**: Stateless compute (horizontally scalable by default)
- **Data Tier**: Database + durable storage

**Design Rule**: The web/app tier should be horizontally scalable BY DEFAULT.

**What I'm Thinking**: "Where is state living? Where does it need to live?"

If state lives in app memory, scaling breaks it.

---

## Decision Tree 1: Scaling

```
Need to handle more load?
|
+-- Mostly CPU/RAM bound + small scale + OK if brief downtime?
|   +-- Vertical scale (scale up) as short-term patch
|
+-- Need high availability OR growth beyond one machine?
    +-- Horizontal scale (scale out)
        +-- Add load balancer
        +-- Make app tier stateless
        +-- Move state to shared systems (DB/cache/object storage)
```

**System-Designer Thought**: Vertical scaling is a DELAY TACTIC; horizontal scaling is an ARCHITECTURE CHOICE.

---

## Decision Tree 2: Database Choice

```
What is the data + correctness need?
|
+-- Strong transactions / invariants (money, inventory, ledgers)?
|   +-- SQL (Postgres/MySQL) + ACID + constraints
|
+-- Clear relationships + joins matter?
|   +-- SQL (normalized + indexes)
|
+-- Semi-structured JSON + evolving schema + high scale writes?
|   +-- Document or wide-column (Mongo/Cassandra)
|
+-- Ultra-low latency key lookup / caching / rate limits / sessions?
|   +-- Key-value (Redis/Memcached)
|
+-- Relationship traversal is the product (social graph, recs)?
    +-- Graph DB (Neo4j/Neptune) or graph model over SQL/NoSQL
```

**What I'm Thinking**: "Where do I want correctness enforced - DB constraints or application code?"

If the DB doesn't enforce it, YOUR BUGS WILL.

---

## Decision Tree 3: API Style

```
Who consumes it and what do they need?
|
+-- Public API, broad compatibility, caching & simplicity matter?
|   +-- REST
|
+-- Complex UI needing shaped responses, reducing round trips?
|   +-- GraphQL (but control query cost + N+1)
|
+-- Internal service-to-service, performance + typed contracts?
    +-- gRPC (protobuf, streaming, strong typing)
```

**Designer Note**: GraphQL often trades "fewer requests" for "harder caching + expensive resolvers."

---

## Decision Tree 4: Protocol Selection

```
What interaction pattern do you need?
|
+-- Simple request/response?
|   +-- HTTPS (default)
|
+-- Real-time push, bidirectional updates (chat, live presence)?
|   +-- WebSockets (plan for sticky connections & backpressure)
|
+-- Async work, decoupling, smoothing spikes (orders, emails)?
|   +-- Queue (AMQP/Kafka/etc.)
|
+-- Microservices needing speed/streaming contracts?
    +-- gRPC over HTTP/2
```

**Transport Layer Reminder**:
- **TCP**: When correctness matters
- **UDP**: When freshness matters more than perfection (voice/video/games)

---

## Decision Tree 5: Load Balancer Algorithm

```
Are servers identical + requests similar?
+-- Round robin

Are sessions variable length (long polls, uploads)?
+-- Least connections

Do servers have different capacity?
+-- Weighted RR / Weighted least-connections

Need stickiness without shared session store?
+-- IP hash (but beware NAT skew) / consistent hashing

Global users?
+-- Geo routing + regional LBs
```

**What I'm Thinking**:
- Health checks AREN'T optional
- The LB forces the real question: "Where do sessions live?"
- If you need stickiness, say why
- If you can avoid it, you should

---

## Decision Tree 6: Cache Placement

```
What are you caching?
|
+-- Static assets (images/js/css)
|   +-- CDN + long TTL + versioned filenames
|
+-- Hot reads that tolerate slight staleness
|   +-- App cache (Redis) + TTL
|
+-- Expensive computed results
    +-- Cache with invalidation strategy + stampede protection
```

**What Impresses Devs**: You mention STAMPEDES (thundering herd) and INVALIDATION as the hardest part:
- TTL + soft TTL
- Request coalescing / single-flight
- Stale-while-revalidate patterns

---

## Decision Tree 7: Authentication

```
Need simple internal tool auth?
+-- Basic auth (only over HTTPS) or SSO

Public app / APIs?
+-- Bearer tokens (often JWT) + refresh token rotation

Need login via Google/GitHub?
+-- OAuth2 + OIDC (identity claims) + secure callback flows
```

---

## Decision Tree 8: Authorization Model

```
How complex are permissions?
|
+-- Few roles, straightforward (admin/editor/viewer)?
|   +-- RBAC
|
+-- Policies depend on attributes (dept, region, device, time)?
|   +-- ABAC
|
+-- Per-object sharing (docs, folders, repos)?
    +-- ACL (often combined with roles)
```

**What I'm Thinking**: Revocation + token rotation + compromise response.
If tokens are "stateless forever," you can't cleanly recover from theft.

---

## SPOF Identification & Mitigation

A clean system design always calls out SPOFs:

| Component | SPOF Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Load Balancer | Single LB failure | Redundancy, failover, managed LB, multi-AZ |
| Database | Single DB failure | Replication + automated failover + backups |
| Cache | Cache failure melts DB | Degrade gracefully (cache miss shouldn't melt DB) |
| Queue | Message loss | Durable broker, replay strategy, idempotent consumers |

**What I'm Thinking**: "How does this fail at 2am under traffic?"
If the answer is "everything stops," you haven't finished.

---

## Security Hardening Checklist

Defense is mostly about AMPLIFICATION CONTROL:

| Defense | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Rate limiting | Per user/IP + global; protect from brute force and cost attacks |
| CORS | Browser constraint, not a full security boundary |
| Injection defense | Parameterized queries + validation + escaping |
| WAF/firewalls | Block known bad patterns, reduce blast radius |
| VPN/private endpoints | Keep internal APIs off the public internet |
| CSRF | Cookie-based auth needs CSRF defenses |
| XSS | Sanitize, escape, CSP, safe templating |

**What I'm Thinking**: "If attacked, what fails closed vs fails open?"

---

## REST API Checklist (Interview Gold)

- Resources are NOUNS: `/users`, `/orders/{id}`
- Proper verbs via HTTP methods (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)
- PAGINATION always for lists (limit/offset or cursor)
- IDEMPOTENCY where needed (especially POST for payments/orders)
- Correct status codes (201 Created, 204 No Content, 400/401/403/404/409/429, 5xx)
- Versioning strategy (URL or headers), deprecation plan

---

## GraphQL Checklist

- Schema mirrors domain, modular types
- Depth/complexity limits
- Avoid N+1 (batching, dataloaders)
- Caching strategy (often app-level)
- Explicit error shape (don't hide failures behind 200-only assumptions)

---

## The Interview-Grade 90-Second Narrative

Use this exact flow:

1. **Clarify** requirements + scale + SLOs + constraints
2. **Baseline** single-server and request flow
3. **Identify bottlenecks** (compute, DB, network, latency, SPOFs)
4. **Evolve architecture**: split tiers -> LB -> stateless app -> DB strategy -> cache/CDN -> queues
5. **Reliability**: failover, replication, graceful degradation
6. **Security**: authn/authz + API hardening
7. **Observability**: logs/metrics/traces, alerting, health checks
8. **Trade-offs**: cost vs latency vs consistency vs complexity

---

## Master Design Flow

```

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Approach |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Premature microservices | Adds complexity before understanding domain | Start monolith, extract when boundaries clear |
| "Make it good" requirements | Unverifiable, subjective | Define binary success criteria |
| Ignoring SPOFs | 2am failures | Every component needs failover plan |
| Stateful app tier | Can't scale horizontally | Move state to shared systems |
| No rate limiting | Cost attacks, brute force | Per-user and global limits |
| Cached forever | Stale data, no invalidation | TTL + explicit invalidation strategy |

---

## Conclusion

System design is about CONSTRAINTS, not TECH. Start with invariants, evolve from baseline, apply decision trees, and always ask: "How does this fail at 2am?"

The organism model helps: every system needs organs (components), circulation (load balancing), immune defenses (security), and survival mechanisms (reliability + observability).

**Philosophy**: Iteration > Perfection. Design for the 10x case, not the 1000x case you'll never reach.
