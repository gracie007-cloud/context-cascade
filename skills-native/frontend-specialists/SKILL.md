# Frontend Specialists


## When to Use This Skill

- **React/Vue/Angular Development**: Building modern frontend applications
- **Component Development**: Creating reusable UI components
- **State Management**: Implementing Redux, Zustand, Pinia, or other state solutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Improving render performance or bundle size
- **Accessibility**: Implementing WCAG-compliant interfaces
- **Responsive Design**: Building mobile-first or adaptive layouts

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- **Backend APIs**: Server-side logic or database operations
- **Static Sites**: Simple HTML/CSS without framework complexity
- **Native Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin (use mobile specialist)
- **Design Work**: Visual design or UI/UX research (use designer)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Components render correctly across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Accessibility score >90 (axe-core, Lighthouse)

- **ALWAYS** clean up effects (removeEventListener, unsubscribe)
- **NEVER** store sensitive data in localStorage
- **ALWAYS** sanitize user input before rendering (prevent XSS)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Component Creation | 10-15 min | Time to scaffold + test |
| Feature Development | 1-2 hours | Implementation + tests |

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Hydration Mismatch (Next.js)
**Solution**: Ensure server/client HTML match. Use `suppressHydrationWarning` for time-dependent content.

### Issue: Slow Performance with Large Lists
**Solution**: Implement virtualization (react-window, react-virtual).

### Issue: Bundle Size Too Large
**Solution**: Use bundle analyzer, code splitting, tree-shaking, dynamic imports.

### Issue: Accessibility Violations
**Solution**: Run axe-core, add ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard support.

## Core Principles

1. **Accessibility is Not Optional, It's Foundational**: Building accessible interfaces isn't a feature to add later or a compliance checkbox - it's a fundamental architectural requirement that shapes component design from the start. Every interactive element must be keyboard navigable, every state change must be announced to screen readers, and every visual distinction must work without color alone. This means using semantic HTML as the foundation (button, nav, main, article), adding ARIA attributes only when semantic HTML is insufficient, and testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers during development, not after. Accessibility failures aren't minor issues - they exclude users and expose organizations to legal liability. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance should be the minimum bar, with automated testing (axe-core) integrated into CI/CD and manual testing with assistive technologies as part of the definition of done.

2. **Performance is a Feature, Not an Afterthought**: Frontend performance directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and SEO rankings. Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1) are measurable business metrics, not abstract technical ideals. This requires performance budgets enforced in CI/CD, lazy loading for routes and heavy components, image optimization with modern formats (WebP, AVIF) and responsive images, code splitting to minimize initial bundle size, and React-specific optimizations like memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Performance optimization isn't premature if it's built into the development workflow - using Lighthouse in CI/CD, profiling with React DevTools, and testing on real devices with throttled connections ensures performance issues are caught before they reach production.

3. **Component Architecture Follows Composition Over Inheritance**: Modern frontend development favors composition patterns where complex UIs are built from small, focused components rather than inheritance hierarchies. Each component should have a single responsibility, accept props for configuration, and compose smaller components rather than implementing monolithic functionality. This means designing component APIs thoughtfully (what should be props vs children vs render props), using TypeScript to enforce prop contracts, implementing controlled vs uncontrolled patterns appropriately, and creating reusable primitives (Button, Input, Card) that compose into domain-specific components (LoginForm, ProductCard). Composition enables reusability, testability, and maintainability - a well-designed component library becomes a shared language across the team with components that can be recombined to solve new problems without modification.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Mutating State Directly** | Directly modifying state objects (state.user.name = 'new') breaks React's reconciliation algorithm, causing components to not re-render or re-rendering inconsistently. React compares previous and next state by reference, so in-place mutations make state appear unchanged. This leads to subtle bugs where UI doesn't update when it should, or updates at unexpected times. | Use immutable update patterns: spread operators for objects ({...state, user: {...state.user, name: 'new'}}), array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, concat instead of push/splice), or state management libraries like Immer that provide immutable-friendly APIs. For complex state, use useReducer with immutable updates or Zustand/Redux with Immer integration. |
| **Skipping Cleanup in useEffect** | Effects that add event listeners, create subscriptions, or start timers without cleanup cause memory leaks and duplicate handlers. Each time the component re-renders, a new effect runs without removing the previous one, accumulating listeners/subscriptions/timers until the browser slows down or crashes. | Always return a cleanup function from useEffect that removes listeners, cancels subscriptions, and clears timers: useEffect(() => { const handler = () => {}; window.addEventListener('resize', handler); return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handler); }, []). Test cleanup by forcing re-renders and checking that handlers aren't duplicated. |
| **Overusing Context for Frequently Changing State** | React Context was designed for infrequent updates (theme, user auth) not frequent changes (form inputs, animation states). When context value changes, all consumers re-render, even if they only use a small part of the context. This causes performance issues where unrelated components re-render on every keystroke or animation frame. | Use context for truly global, infrequent state. For frequent updates, use local component state, or specialized state management (Zustand, Redux) with selector-based subscriptions that only re-render when relevant data changes. For form state, use React Hook Form or similar libraries that minimize re-renders. Split large contexts into smaller, focused contexts to reduce re-render scope. |

## Conclusion
