## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Simple data preprocessing without model training
- Statistical analysis that does not require ML models
- Rule-based systems without learning components
- Operations that do not involve model training or inference

## Success Criteria

- Model training convergence: Loss decreasing consistently
- Validation accuracy: Meeting or exceeding baseline targets
- Training time: Within expected bounds for dataset size
- GPU utilization: >80% during training
- Model export success: 100% successful saves
- Inference latency: <100ms for real-time applications

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

- **GPU Memory Overflow**: Reduce batch size, use gradient accumulation, or mixed precision
- **Divergent Training**: Implement learning rate scheduling, gradient clipping
- **Data Pipeline Failures**: Validate data integrity, handle missing/corrupted files
- **Version Mismatches**: Lock dependency versions, use containerization
- **Checkpoint Corruption**: Save multiple checkpoints, validate before loading
- **Distributed Training Failures**: Handle node failures, implement fault tolerance

## Guardrails & Safety

- NEVER train on unvalidated or uncleaned data
- ALWAYS validate model outputs before deployment
- ALWAYS implement reproducibility (random seeds, version pinning)
- NEVER expose training data in model artifacts or logs
- ALWAYS monitor for bias and fairness issues
- ALWAYS implement model versioning and rollback capabilities

## Evidence-Based Validation

- Verify hardware availability: Check GPU/TPU status before training
- Validate data quality: Run data integrity checks and statistics
- Monitor training: Track loss curves, gradients, and metrics
- Test model performance: Evaluate on held-out test set
- Benchmark inference: Measure latency and throughput under load

## Core Principles

Machine Learning Development operates on 3 fundamental principles:

### Principle 1: Reproducibility Through Determinism
Every training run must be reproducible via fixed random seeds, version-locked dependencies, and containerized environments to enable scientific validation.

In practice:
- Set random seeds for PyTorch, NumPy, and Python at training initialization
- Lock dependency versions in requirements.txt with exact versions (==, not >=)
- Use Docker containers with pinned base images for training environments
- Version datasets with DVC to ensure identical train/validation/test splits

### Principle 2: Multi-Metric Holistic Evaluation
Model quality cannot be reduced to single metrics; accuracy, fairness, robustness, efficiency, interpretability, and safety must all be evaluated.

In practice:
- Track accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1) alongside fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Measure robustness via adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution detection
- Monitor efficiency (inference latency, model size, FLOPS) for deployment feasibility
- Assess interpretability through feature importance, saliency maps, or SHAP values

### Principle 3: Deployment-Aware Training
Models must be trained with deployment constraints in mind - target latency, memory footprint, and inference hardware determine architecture choices.

In practice:
- Profile inference latency on target hardware (CPU, GPU, TPU, mobile) early in development
- Apply model compression (quantization, pruning, distillation) before final training
- Design architectures compatible with deployment frameworks (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML)
- Monitor resource usage during training to predict deployment costs

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Unreproducible Training** | No fixed seeds, floating dependencies, or undocumented preprocessing prevents validation | Set seeds, lock versions, version datasets with DVC, document preprocessing |
| **Accuracy-Only Evaluation** | Ignoring fairness, robustness, or efficiency leads to biased or unusable models | Implement holistic evaluation with 6+ metric categories (see holistic-evaluation skill) |
| **Training Without Validation** | No held-out test set or k-fold validation causes overfitting and poor generalization | Always split data into train/val/test; use cross-validation for small datasets |
| **Ignoring Deployment Constraints** | Training massive models incompatible with target hardware wastes resources | Profile inference latency early; apply compression techniques before training |
| **Manual Hyperparameter Tuning** | Grid search or manual tuning is slow and suboptimal | Use automated hyperparameter optimization (Optuna, Ray Tune) |
