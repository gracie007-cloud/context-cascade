## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- User requests pair programming session
- Real-time collaborative coding needed
- Code review required during development
- TDD workflow with immediate feedback desired
- Learning/mentoring session for coding practices
- Debugging complex issues with second perspective
- Refactoring with continuous quality checks

## Skill Overview

This skill provides AI-assisted pair programming with three distinct modes: Driver/Navigator (traditional pairing), Switch Mode (role reversal), and TDD Mode (test-first development). Real-time quality monitoring, security scanning, and performance optimization ensure high-quality code output.

## 7-Phase Skill-Forge Methodology

### Phase 1: Session Initialization

**Objective**: Set up pair programming environment and establish session parameters

**Agent**: `coder` (session lead)

**Activities**:
- Initialize pair programming session
- Determine programming mode (driver/navigator/switch/tdd)
- Set up shared workspace and memory
- Configure quality thresholds and monitoring
- Establish coding standards and conventions
- Define session goals and success criteria

**Memory Keys**:

# Initialize session
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "swarm/pair-programming/session-state/mode" "$SELECTED_MODE"
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "swarm/pair-programming/session-state/goals" "$SESSION_GOALS"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Pair programming session started: $SELECTED_MODE mode"
```

### Phase 2: Driver Mode (Code Implementation)

**Objective**: Write code with real-time navigator feedback

npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "swarm/pair-programming/session-state/current-navigator" "$NEW_NAVIGATOR"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Roles switched: $NEW_DRIVER now driving"
```

### Phase 7: Session Completion & Summary

**Objective**: Wrap up session and generate comprehensive summary

npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Session completion"
METRICS=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve "swarm/pair-programming/metrics/*")
TEST_RESULTS=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve "swarm/pair-programming/test-results/*")
# Generate summary
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "swarm/pair-programming/session-state/summary" "$SESSION_SUMMARY"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks session-end --export-metrics true
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Pair programming session completed"
```

## Programming Modes

### 1. Driver/Navigator Mode (Traditional)

**Driver (Coder)**:
- Writes code and implements functionality
- Explains approach while coding
- Focuses on tactical implementation details

**Navigator (Reviewer)**:
- Reviews code in real-time
- Thinks strategically about architecture
- Catches mistakes and suggests improvements
- Asks clarifying questions

### 2. Switch Mode (Role Reversal)

- Roles switch after each feature/task completion
- Promotes shared understanding and knowledge transfer
- Prevents driver fatigue and tunnel vision
- Ensures both agents experience both perspectives

### 3. TDD Mode (Test-First)

**Navigator writes tests first**:
- Define expected behavior through tests
- Set clear success criteria

**Driver implements to pass tests**:
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- Refactor once tests pass

### 4. Debugging Mode

**Driver investigates issue**:
- Reproduce bug
- Add logging and debugging
- Propose hypothesis

**Navigator**:
- Review hypothesis
- Suggest alternative approaches
- Verify fix doesn't introduce regressions

### 5. Refactoring Mode

**Driver refactors code**:
- Improve structure and readability
- Apply design patterns
- Remove duplication

**Navigator ensures**:
- Tests still pass
- Behavior unchanged
- Quality improved

## Complete Workflow Orchestration

## Memory Coordination Patterns

### Real-Time Collaboration Flow

```
coder (driver) ←→ reviewer (navigator)
     ↓                    ↓
     ↓→ shared memory ←↓
     ↓                    ↓
tester ←→ performance-analyzer
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Implementing New Feature with TDD

```bash
# User request
"Pair program with me to implement a caching layer with Redis. Use TDD approach."

# Workflow:
# 1. Initialize session in TDD mode
# 2. Navigator writes test specifications first
# 3. Driver implements Redis cache to pass tests
# 4. Navigator reviews implementation real-time
# 5. Tester runs test suite continuously
# 6. Performance analyzer checks Redis connection pool
# 7. Switch roles for next iteration
# 8. Generate session summary with learnings
```

### Example 2: Debugging Production Issue

```bash
# User request
"Help me debug why our API is returning 500 errors intermittently"

# Workflow:
# 1. Initialize session in debugging mode
# 2. Driver reproduces issue with logging
# 3. Navigator reviews error patterns and suggests hypothesis
# 4. Driver implements fix with additional error handling
# 5. Tester runs regression tests
# 6. Performance analyzer checks impact on latency
# 7. Session summary documents root cause and fix
```

### Example 3: Refactoring Legacy Code

```bash
# User request
"Refactor our monolithic user service into microservices with me"

# Workflow:
# 1. Initialize session in refactoring mode
# 2. Driver extracts user authentication logic
# 3. Navigator ensures API contracts maintained
# 4. Tester verifies all existing tests still pass
# 5. Performance analyzer checks for performance regression
# 6. Switch roles for next microservice extraction
# 7. Document architectural changes in summary
```

## Best Practices

1. **Communicate constantly** - Driver explains thinking, navigator asks questions
2. **Small iterations** - Commit frequently, review often
3. **Trust verification** - Run tests after every significant change
4. **Quality gates** - Don't proceed if quality score drops below threshold
5. **Switch regularly** - Prevent fatigue, share knowledge
6. **Memory coordination** - Use shared memory for context
7. **Learn together** - Document insights and patterns
8. **Respect roles** - Driver focuses on implementation, navigator on strategy

## Quality Thresholds

- **Code Quality Score**: ≥ 80/100
- **Test Coverage**: ≥ 90%
- **Complexity Score**: ≤ 10 per function
- **Duplication**: ≤ 5%
- **Security Issues**: 0 critical, 0 high
- **Performance Regression**: ≤ 10% increase

## Troubleshooting

**Navigator feedback not being incorporated**:
- Check memory coordination working correctly
- Ensure driver retrieving feedback from memory
- Verify communication flow in logs

**Tests failing after changes**:
- Driver should revert or fix immediately
- Navigator reviews test failures with driver
- Tester provides detailed failure analysis

**Quality score dropping**:
- Performance analyzer alerts immediately
- Navigator and driver review quality metrics together
- Consider refactoring before proceeding

## !! SKILL COMPLETION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY) !!

**After invoking this skill, you MUST complete ALL items below before proceeding:**

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Agent Spawning**: Did you spawn at least 1 agent via Task()?
  - Example: `Task("Agent Name", "Task description", "agent-type-from-registry")`

- [ ] **Agent Registry Validation**: Is your agent from the registry?
  - Registry location: `claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/agents/`
  - Valid categories: delivery, foundry, operations, orchestration, platforms, quality, research, security, specialists, tooling
  - NOT valid: Made-up agent names

- [ ] **TodoWrite Called**: Did you call TodoWrite with 5+ todos?
  - Example: `TodoWrite({ todos: [8-10 items covering all work] })`

- [ ] **Work Delegation**: Did you delegate to agents (not do work yourself)?
  - CORRECT: Agents do the implementation via Task()
  - WRONG: You write the code directly after reading skill

### Correct Pattern After Skill Invocation

```javascript
// After Skill("<skill-name>") is invoked:
[Single Message - ALL in parallel]:
  Task("Agent 1", "Description of task 1...", "agent-type-1")
  Task("Agent 2", "Description of task 2...", "agent-type-2")
  Task("Agent 3", "Description of task 3...", "agent-type-3")
  TodoWrite({ todos: [
    {content: "Task 1 description", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Working on task 1"},
    {content: "Task 2 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 2"},
    {content: "Task 3 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 3"},
  ]})
```

### Wrong Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS)

```javascript
// WRONG - Reading skill and then doing work yourself:
Skill("<skill-name>")
// Then you write all the code yourself without Task() calls
// This defeats the purpose of the skill system!
```

**The skill is NOT complete until all checklist items are checked.**

---

**Remember the pattern: Skill() -> Task() -> TodoWrite() - ALWAYS**
