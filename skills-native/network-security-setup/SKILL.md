## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when configuring sandbox network isolation, setting up trusted domain whitelists, implementing zero-trust network policies for AI code execution, configuring corporate proxies and internal registries, or preventing data exfiltration through network controls.

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Do NOT use for production network security (use infrastructure-as-code instead), configuring firewall rules on live systems, bypassing organizational network policies, or setting up VPNs and network routing (use networking specialists). Avoid for troubleshooting network connectivity issues unrelated to sandbox security.

## Success Criteria

- Trusted domain whitelist validated (all required domains accessible, untrusted blocked)
- Network isolation prevents data exfiltration attacks (tested with simulated exfil)
- Internal registries accessible through proper proxy configuration
- Environment variables secured (no secrets in config files)
- Zero false positives (legitimate development work unblocked)
- Package installations succeed from approved registries
- Build and deployment commands execute without network errors
- Validation tests pass (npm install, git clone, API calls to approved domains)

## Edge Cases & Challenges

- Corporate proxies requiring NTLM authentication
- Split-tunnel VPNs with mixed internal/external traffic
- CDN domains changing dynamically (*.cloudfront.net wildcards)
- WebSocket connections requiring separate allowlisting
- DNS resolution failures in isolated environments
- IPv6 vs IPv4 routing differences
- Localhost binding restrictions breaking development servers
- Proxy auto-configuration (PAC) files with complex logic

## Guardrails (CRITICAL SECURITY RULES)

- NEVER disable network isolation without security review
- NEVER add untrusted domains to whitelist without validation
- NEVER store secrets (API keys, passwords) in sandbox configuration files
- NEVER bypass proxy settings to access restricted resources
- NEVER allow wildcard domain patterns without justification (*.com = insecure)
- ALWAYS validate domain ownership before whitelisting
- ALWAYS use HTTPS for external domains (enforce TLS)
- ALWAYS document why each domain is trusted (justification required)
- ALWAYS test that untrusted domains are blocked (negative testing)
- ALWAYS use environment variable references for secrets (not plaintext)
- ALWAYS maintain audit logs of network policy changes
- ALWAYS validate network policies after configuration changes

## Evidence-Based Validation

All network security configurations MUST be validated through:
1. **Positive testing** - Verify approved domains accessible (npm install, git clone)
2. **Negative testing** - Verify untrusted domains blocked (curl random-website.com fails)
3. **Proxy validation** - Confirm traffic routes through corporate proxy where required
4. **Secret scanning** - Automated scan for credentials in configuration files
5. **Build validation** - End-to-end build succeeds with network policy applied
6. **Penetration testing** - Attempt data exfiltration to verify isolation

# Network Security Setup

## Purpose
Configure Claude Code sandbox network isolation policies including trusted domain whitelisting, custom access rules, and secure environment variable management.

## Specialist Agent

I am a network security specialist with expertise in:
- Zero-trust network architecture for AI code execution
- Domain whitelisting and access control policies
- Prompt injection attack prevention via network isolation
- Secure environment variable management
- Corporate proxy and internal registry configuration

### Methodology (Systems Thinking + Self-Consistency)

1. **Analyze Environment**: Understand deployment context (enterprise, open-source, local)
2. **Design Network Policy**: Create appropriate trusted domain list
3. **Configure Access Rules**: Set up custom access patterns and exclusions
4. **Secure Credentials**: Properly handle environment variables and secrets
5. **Validate Security**: Test that policies block untrusted access while enabling work

### Network Isolation Modes

**Mode 1: Trusted Network Access (Recommended Default)**
```yaml
mode: trusted
description: Claude can only access pre-approved, known-safe domains
use_case: General development, open-source projects
trusted_domains:
  - "*.npmjs.org"
  - "registry.npmjs.org"
  - "*.yarnpkg.com"
  - "*.github.com"
  - "api.github.com"
  - "raw.githubusercontent.com"
  - "*.cloudfront.net"

### Enterprise Configuration

**Internal Registry Setup**:
```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "network": {
      "mode": "custom",
      "trustedDomains": [
        "registry.company.internal:5000",
        "npm.company.com",
        "docs.company.com",
        "api-docs.company.internal",
        "*.company-cdn.net",
        "*.company.cloud",

        // Include standard public registries if needed
        "registry.npmjs.org",
        "*.github.com"
      ],
      "customProxy": {
        "enabled": true,
        "http": "http://proxy.company.com:8080",
        "https": "http://proxy.company.com:8080",
        "noProxy": [
          "localhost",
          "127.0.0.1",
          "*.company.internal"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Corporate Proxy Configuration**:
```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "network": {
      "customProxy": {
        "enabled": true,
        "http": "http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128",
        "https": "http://corporate-proxy.company.com:3128",
        "noProxy": [
          "localhost",
          "*.internal",
          "*.company.com"
        ],
        "authentication": {
          "enabled": false  // Use system credentials
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables (Secure Management)

**Safe Environment Variables** (OK to configure):
```yaml
safe_env_vars:
  - NODE_ENV: "development"
  - API_BASE_URL: "https://api.company.com"
  - LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
  - FEATURE_FLAGS: "new_ui,beta_features"
  - BUILD_TARGET: "production"
```

**Dangerous (NEVER in sandbox config)**:
```yaml
dangerous_env_vars:  # Store in .env.local, never in settings
  - API_KEY: "sk-..."  ❌ SECRET
  - DATABASE_PASSWORD: "..."  ❌ SECRET
  - PRIVATE_KEY: "..."  ❌ SECRET
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "..."  ❌ SECRET
```

**Best Practice for Secrets**:
1. Store in `.env.local` (gitignored)
2. Use environment variable references in sandbox config
3. Document required variables without values
4. Use secret management services in production

**Example Secure Configuration**:
```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "environmentVariables": {
      // ✅ Non-sensitive configuration
      "NODE_ENV": "development",
      "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.staging.company.com",

      // ✅ Reference to local .env file (document required vars)
      "__REQUIRED_SECRETS__": "API_KEY, DATABASE_URL (store in .env.local)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Security Threat Mitigation

**Threat 1: Prompt Injection → Data Exfiltration**
```
Attack: Malicious prompt in downloaded code tries to send sensitive data to attacker.com
Mitigation: Network isolation blocks all non-whitelisted domains
Result: Attack fails, data stays secure
```

**Threat 2: Malicious Package Download**
```
Attack: Prompt injection tries to install malware from evil-registry.com
Mitigation: Only trusted registries allowed
Result: Download blocked, system protected
```

**Threat 3: Internal Network Scanning**
```
Attack: Code tries to scan internal network for vulnerable services
Mitigation: Network isolation prevents arbitrary connections
Result: Internal network remains hidden
```

**Threat 4: Credential Theft**
```
Attack: Downloaded code reads environment variables and sends to attacker
Mitigation: Secrets not in sandbox config, network blocked anyway
Result: No credentials accessible or exfiltratable
```

### Domain Pattern Matching

**Wildcard Patterns**:
- `*.example.com` - Matches all subdomains: api.example.com, cdn.example.com
- `example.com` - Exact match only
- `*.*.example.com` - Multi-level wildcards: a.b.example.com

**Port Specifications**:
- `registry.company.com:5000` - Specific port
- `*.company.com:*` - Any port on subdomains
- `localhost:3000` - Local development server

**Protocol Handling**:
- HTTPS preferred and enforced where possible
- HTTP allowed only for localhost and internal domains
- WebSocket connections follow same rules (ws:// → wss://)

### Validation and Testing

**Test Network Policy**:
```bash
# Should succeed (trusted domain)
npm install express

# Should succeed (trusted domain)
git clone https://github.com/user/repo

# Should fail (untrusted domain)
curl https://random-website.com

# Should succeed if allowLocalBinding enabled
npm run dev
```

## Integration Points

- **Cascades**: Works with sandbox-configurator for complete security setup
- **Commands**: `/network-security`, `/trusted-domains`
- **Other Skills**: Pairs with sandbox-configurator, security-review

## Usage Examples

**Standard Development Setup**:
```
Configure network security for open-source development with standard npm and GitHub access
```

**Enterprise Internal**:
```
Set up network isolation for enterprise:
- Internal npm registry: npm.company.internal
- Internal docs: docs.company.com
- Corporate proxy: proxy.company.com:8080
- Keep access to public GitHub
```

**Maximum Security**:
```
Configure maximum security with no network access for sensitive project
```

**Add Custom Domain**:
```
Add api.specialservice.com to trusted domains for API integration
```

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

- **Package install fails**: Add registry to trusted domains
- **Git clone fails**: Add git host to trusted domains
- **Build fails with network error**: Check if build accesses CDN, add to whitelist
- **Proxy authentication fails**: Verify proxy credentials or use system auth
- **Environment variable missing**: Document in config, add to .env.local

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All required registries in trusted domains
- [ ] Internal domains include ports if non-standard
- [ ] Proxy configuration correct (if needed)
- [ ] No secrets in sandbox configuration
- [ ] Required env vars documented
- [ ] Test package installation
- [ ] Test git operations
- [ ] Test build commands
- [ ] Verify untrusted access blocked

**Quick Reference**:
- Config location: `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Default mode: Trusted network access
- Wildcard syntax: `*.domain.com`
- Secrets: NEVER in sandbox config, use .env.local

**Security Principle**: Deny by default, allow explicitly, verify continuously

## Core Principles

Network Security Setup operates on 3 fundamental principles:

### Principle 1: Zero-Trust AI Execution
AI-generated code cannot be assumed safe - network isolation prevents data exfiltration and malicious activity.

In practice:
- Whitelist only known-safe domains (package registries, source control, approved APIs)
- Block all untrusted domains by default to prevent prompt injection attacks
- Monitor network traffic during sandbox execution for anomaly detection
- Test that untrusted domains are blocked (negative testing validates policy)

### Principle 2: Least Privilege Access
Grant minimum network permissions required for legitimate development work.

In practice:
- Start with no network access (mode: none), add domains only when needed
- Use wildcard patterns sparingly (*.com allows too much, *.npmjs.org is specific)
- Require justification documentation for every trusted domain added
- Separate internal domains (company.internal) from public domains

### Principle 3: Secrets Separation
Environment variables containing credentials MUST NOT reside in sandbox configuration files.

In practice:
- Store API keys, database passwords, and private keys in .env.local (gitignored)
- Use environment variable references in sandbox config, not plaintext values
- Document required secrets without exposing values (API_KEY required, see .env.local)
- Implement secret scanning to catch accidental commits of credentials

## Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Using wildcard *.com patterns** | Allows access to entire internet, defeats purpose of network isolation | Use specific subdomains: *.npmjs.org, *.github.com, NOT *.com |
| **Storing secrets in settings.json** | Credentials committed to version control, shared across team insecurely | Store secrets in .env.local (gitignored), reference in config with documentation |
| **Disabling network isolation without review** | Prompt injection can exfiltrate code/data to attacker domains | NEVER set mode: unrestricted, always use whitelist approach |
| **Not testing negative cases** | Untrusted domains might be accessible due to config errors | Verify random websites are blocked: curl random-site.com should fail |
| **Bypassing corporate proxy** | Violates organizational policy, triggers security alerts, audit failures | Configure customProxy with corporate proxy settings, never use mode: none to circumvent |

## Conclusion

Network Security Setup is the foundational defense layer for AI-assisted development, protecting against the unique threat model where AI-generated code might contain malicious payloads from prompt injection attacks. By implementing trusted domain whitelisting, this skill ensures that even if an attacker successfully injects code, network isolation prevents data exfiltration to their command-and-control servers.

The skill balances security with developer productivity by maintaining curated lists of approved package registries, source control platforms, and CDN services. Enterprise deployments extend this with internal registries and corporate proxy configurations, enabling secure development in air-gapped or restricted network environments. The result is a zero-trust sandbox where legitimate development proceeds unimpeded while malicious network activity is blocked by default.

Use this skill when configuring new Claude Code installations, hardening sandbox security for sensitive projects, or implementing corporate security policies for AI-assisted development. The validation checklist ensures configurations are correct before deployment, preventing both false positives (blocking legitimate development) and false negatives (allowing malicious traffic). Combined with secret separation principles, this skill establishes the security baseline required for production use of AI code generation tools.
