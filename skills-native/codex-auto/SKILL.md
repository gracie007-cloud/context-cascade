# Codex Full Auto Skill

## Purpose
Leverage Codex CLI's Full Auto mode for unattended, sandboxed prototyping where the AI can autonomously read, write, and execute code without approval - perfect for rapid scaffolding and overnight builds.

## Unique Capability
**What Claude Code Can't Do**: Run completely autonomously without user approval for extended periods. Codex Full Auto mode can prototype entire features, fix broken builds, or scaffold projects while you're away - all in a secure sandbox.

## When to Use

### Perfect For:
✅ Rapid prototyping of new features
✅ Scaffolding entire projects (APIs, apps, tools)
✅ Fixing broken builds while you're away
✅ Automated refactoring tasks
✅ Generating boilerplate code
✅ "Set it and forget it" tasks
✅ Exploring implementation approaches

### Don't Use When:
❌ Need human oversight for critical decisions
❌ Working with production systems
❌ Requires network access (Full Auto disables network)
❌ Need to access resources outside project directory

## How It Works

Codex Full Auto mode:
- ✅ Reads/writes files automatically
- ✅ Executes commands in sandbox
- ✅ Iterates on its own output
- ⚠️ **Network disabled** for security
- ⚠️ **CWD only** - can't access outside project
- ⚠️ Uses macOS Seatbelt / Docker sandbox

## Usage

### Basic Auto Prototyping
```
/codex-auto "Create a REST API with user CRUD operations using Express and SQLite"
```

### Scaffolding
```
/codex-auto "Build a complete todo app with React frontend and Node.js backend, include tests"
```

### Overnight Task
```
/codex-auto "Refactor entire src/ directory to use TypeScript strict mode, fix all type errors"
```

## Safety

Full Auto runs in **secure sandbox**:
- Network: **DISABLED** (no external connections)
- Scope: **CWD only** (current working directory)
- Isolation: **Seatbelt (macOS) / Docker**
- Can't: Access parent dirs, make network calls, modify system

## Command Pattern
```bash
codex --full-auto "Detailed task description"
# Equivalent to: codex -a on-failure -s workspace-write
```

## Real Examples

### Example 1: API Scaffolding
```
/codex-auto "Create Express REST API with:
- User endpoints (CRUD)
- JWT authentication
- Input validation
- Error handling
- SQLite database
- Tests with Jest"

Result: Complete API in ~45 minutes
```

### Example 2: Refactoring
```
/codex-auto "Refactor all components in src/components to use hooks instead of class components, preserve all functionality"

Result: All components refactored, tests passing
```
