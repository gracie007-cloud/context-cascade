## Assigned Agents

### Primary Agent
- **researcher** - Best match for Phase 1 (requirements analysis). Handles feature requirement gathering, best practice research, constraint identification, and success criteria definition. Coordinates initial research phase and sets foundation for all downstream work.

### Secondary Agents
- **system-architect** - Phase 2: Architecture design and API contract definition
- **planner** - Phase 3: Implementation planning and task breakdown
- **coder** - Phase 4b: Feature implementation following TDD approach
- **tester** - Phase 4a: Test specification and validation (TDD first)
- **reviewer** - Phase 5: Code review, security scanning, and quality assurance
- **api-docs** - Phase 6: API documentation and user guide generation
- **cicd-engineer** - Phase 7: CI/CD pipeline configuration and deployment setup

### Fallback Agents
- **sparc-coord** - Alternative coordinator if hierarchical-coordinator unavailable
- **sparc-coder** - Alternative implementation if coder unavailable
- **production-validator** - Alternative validation if reviewer unavailable

### Coordination Pattern
**Pattern**: Hierarchical Multi-Phase Workflow (7 phases)
**Topology**: Hierarchical coordination with sequential phases and memory-based handoffs
**Memory Namespace**: `swarm/feature-dev/*` (requirements, architecture, planning, implementation, review, docs, deployment)

**Agent Collaboration**:
1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Each phase waits for previous phase completion via memory
2. **Parallel Execution**: Phase 4 has tester + coder working concurrently (TDD)
3. **Quality Gates**: Phase 5 review must approve before Phase 6/7 proceed
4. **Hooks Integration**: All agents use pre-task/post-task/notify hooks for coordination
5. **Session Management**: Complete workflow tracked with session-id for restore/export

**Utilization**: This is a high-coordination skill using 7 specialized agents across the complete development lifecycle. Demonstrates full SPARC methodology integration.

## Trigger Conditions

Use this skill when:
- User requests a new feature from conception to production
- Complete feature lifecycle needed (research → deploy)
- Multi-phase development with quality gates required
- Cross-functional coordination between multiple specialists

│   ├── index.ts          # Main feature entry
│   ├── types.ts          # TypeScript definitions
│   ├── api.ts            # API endpoints
│   └── utils.ts          # Utility functions

```

## Usage Example

```bash
# User request
"Develop a complete user authentication feature with JWT tokens, email verification,
password reset, and role-based access control"

# Skill automatically orchestrates:
# 1. Research OAuth best practices, JWT standards
# 2. Design authentication architecture with token refresh
# 3. Plan implementation sequence
# 4. Write comprehensive auth tests (TDD)
# 5. Implement auth service, middleware, endpoints
# 6. Review for security vulnerabilities
# 7. Generate API docs and integration guide
# 8. Configure CI/CD with security scanning
```

## Extension Points

- Custom agent addition for specialized needs
- Additional quality gates between phases
- Integration with external services (monitoring, analytics)
- Custom memory patterns for domain-specific coordination
- Deployment to multiple environments (staging, prod)

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with requirements** - Don't skip research phase
2. **Use TDD approach** - Tests before implementation
3. **Memory coordination** - All agents use shared memory for context
4. **Hooks automation** - Pre/post task hooks for tracking
5. **Quality gates** - Don't proceed if review fails
6. **Documentation first** - Generate docs from approved code
7. **Deployment readiness** - CI/CD configured before deployment

## Troubleshooting

**Tests failing during implementation**:
- Review test specifications with tester agent
- Check architecture contracts match implementation
- Verify memory coordination working correctly

**Code review rejections**:
- Coordinate between reviewer and coder for fixes
- Store review findings in memory for reference
- Re-run review after fixes applied

**Deployment issues**:
- Verify all tests passing
- Check CI/CD configuration
- Ensure environment variables set correctly

*This skill provides comprehensive feature development with multi-agent coordination, ensuring production-ready features with complete testing and documentation.*

## !! SKILL COMPLETION VERIFICATION (MANDATORY) !!

**After invoking this skill, you MUST complete ALL items below before proceeding:**

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] **Agent Spawning**: Did you spawn at least 1 agent via Task()?
  - Example: `Task("Agent Name", "Task description", "agent-type-from-registry")`

- [ ] **Agent Registry Validation**: Is your agent from the registry?
  - Registry location: `claude-code-plugins/ruv-sparc-three-loop-system/agents/`
  - Valid categories: delivery, foundry, operations, orchestration, platforms, quality, research, security, specialists, tooling
  - NOT valid: Made-up agent names

- [ ] **TodoWrite Called**: Did you call TodoWrite with 5+ todos?
  - Example: `TodoWrite({ todos: [8-10 items covering all work] })`

- [ ] **Work Delegation**: Did you delegate to agents (not do work yourself)?
  - CORRECT: Agents do the implementation via Task()
  - WRONG: You write the code directly after reading skill

### Correct Pattern After Skill Invocation

```javascript
// After Skill("<skill-name>") is invoked:
[Single Message - ALL in parallel]:
  Task("Agent 1", "Description of task 1...", "agent-type-1")
  Task("Agent 2", "Description of task 2...", "agent-type-2")
  Task("Agent 3", "Description of task 3...", "agent-type-3")
  TodoWrite({ todos: [
    {content: "Task 1 description", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "Working on task 1"},
    {content: "Task 2 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 2"},
    {content: "Task 3 description", status: "pending", activeForm: "Working on task 3"},
  ]})
```

### Wrong Pattern (DO NOT DO THIS)

```javascript
// WRONG - Reading skill and then doing work yourself:
Skill("<skill-name>")
// Then you write all the code yourself without Task() calls
// This defeats the purpose of the skill system!
```

**The skill is NOT complete until all checklist items are checked.**

---

**Remember the pattern: Skill() -> Task() -> TodoWrite() - ALWAYS**
